But do you know what it means to know something? We've spent quite a bit of time discussing beliefs and knowledge, but we haven't really been specific about what we mean when we talk about those things. Thankfully philosophers love a good definition. They have very specific and lucid ideas in mind when they use terms like know or internet trolls, or other people who confuse arguing with sniping back and forth, or just thinking up witty comebacks. Nope, philosophers have all kinds of rhetorical devices at their disposal that they can use to advance an idea or call into question the ideas of their interlocutors. So in order to hold your own in a philosophical debate, you're gonna have to know the difference between two things that sound like exactly the same thing, an assertion and a proposition. And you'll need to be able to tell when someone actually knows what is your proposition. It's the underlying meaning of what you're saying. So even though an assertion itself can change depending on, say, what language it's spoken in, its meaning doesn't change just because its outer packaging does. Like, this is a cat, and Estes un gato both assert the same proposition. And a proposition is true if it asserts a claim that corresponds to reality. The proposition, when I assert this is a cat, is true if the object of the this is, in fact, a cat, and false if it is anything I have a belief. What all this means is that I, like everyone else, can have false beliefs. Simply thinking something doesn't make it correspond to reality, which is what's needed for truth. But of course, the fun of arguing is showing off what you know to other people, or at least producing really clever evidence to support your case. So this raises the question of what it means to actually know something in the philosophical sense. The traditional definition of knowledge is that it's a justified, true belief. Know that there testimony, which you accepted as justification for your knowledge and your beliefs. But justification can come in other forms, too. Another common type is first-person observation. Information you acquire through your senses. If I believe that a cat is a cat because I same job. The president of the company told Smith that Jones will get the job. This counts as evidence. The president of the company would seem to be a reliable source of this information. Meanwhile, Smith counts the coins in world was turned upside down by this idea, and philosophers, loving a good counter example, began generating their own gettier cases. American philosopher Roderick Chisholm proposed this one. Looking across a field, you see an object that looks like a sheep, and you form the belief that there is a sheep in the field. It turns out that the object you see is actually a dog. Yet there is also a sheep, obscured from your vision by a hill. So you have a justified true belief, but the justification for your belief. That\", 'Philosophy'], [\" Close your eyes and imagine a bronze statue of a cat. No, that's a cute kitty. Yeah. But now imagine the statue was placed at the top of a staircase at some big university. Since college students can get up to all kinds of tricks, school officials have placed a chain around the neck of the statue, securing it to its podium to keep it from being spirited away on some raucous Friday night. The statue, as created by the artist, was unchained,? Are you emotionally invested in the characters of your favorite shows and books? All of these experiences are examples of aesthetic appreciation. Philosophers who ponder how and why aesthetic objects have such a hold on us and what value they serve in our lives are known as estheticians. And one major question that estheticians deal with is what actually is art. That's a pretty heavy topic, but one way of tackling ineffable emotions of the person who created it. In this view, an artist creates as a way of communicating feelings to other people, oftentimes feelings that can't be expressed in mere words. But in some cases, the creation of art might not be about communicating at all. It might just be a way to purge overpowering emotions that are raging inside of the artist. Some thinkers argue that the intention of the artist is really about it, the more impossible it seems to define. So maybe the answer is to take the Wittgensteinian approach and argue that the concept of art defies definition, but you know it when you see it. That'll do, I guess, but it won't help you decide whether the chain on the cat statue was part of the artwork or not. To help out here, let's head over to the Thought Bubble for some flash philosophy. Say there's a row of being called art. But... what is that thing? Is it something that exists in the minds of the artists, or the audience, or some historical facts about the work's creation that makes the works different? If Thetics falls into the broad category of value theory, which also includes ethics. But unlike ethics, where many people think that there are absolute right and wrong answers, like killing is wrong and. But the question of, is it good, is another matter entirely? Hume thought that aesthetic value was objective, to some extent, and that we're all predisposed to find certain objects and patterns to be aesthetically pleasing. For example, he said appreciating works of art. But you might share Hume's view that an ability to appreciate things can be acquired, and that greater aesthetic appreciation can be valuable for its own sake, because it gives you pleasure and it lets you understand things about the world and other people that you might otherwise miss.

For generations, just about everybody in the United States got vaccinations. And I'm sure there will be no conversation about this in the comments.

Even though that study was later discredited, ever since then, a small but vocal subset of parents, encourage others to share their beliefs. But over the past 200 years or so, philosophers have developed some pretty compelling responses to this phenomenon. A few thinkers have come up with useful ways of thinking about the beliefs we have and the harm they can cause and no one blamed him for the tragedy. Now, most people would agree that the ship owner was responsible for the deaths of the ship's passengers, but Clifford went even further. He argued that the owner would have been guilty even if the ship managed to make the trip safely. Because he was guilty of accepting a belief without sufficient evidence, and whether our views always have the potential to harm others, W.K. Clifford argued that we have an epistemic responsibility only to believe things for which we have evidence. And if you don't have evidence, you are morally obligated to refrain from the belief. Basically, you should withhold judgment until you investigate the study. One thing his arguments were meant to show is that religious belief is epistemically irresponsible. Belief in a god whose existence can't be proven was simply blind faith, he said. And blind faith pumpkin spice latte, but you love pumpkin and you love lattes and you love spice, so you hypothesize that you would enjoy a pumpkin spice latte.

On the other hand, you probably can't even entertain the possibility that you would enjoy like a dog food spice latte. Try as you might, you just can't imagine accepting that option as an actual belief, so that's a dead option to you. Now, a said believing in God is a live option for himself and a whole lot of other people. He also argued that religious belief is a forced option. That's because he didn't buy the idea that agnosticism was really a thing. He figured that withholding judgment is the same as not believing, so you either believe in God or you don't. Finally, James thought religious belief is momentous. It has the possibility to greatly improve your life. So he concluded that we are justified in believing in God and the absence of evidence through faith alone.

Some of them come out and find that the real world was a belief that the ordinary reality of the material world is only a shadowy approximation of ultimate reality. Socrates, meanwhile, who was widely believed to be the wisest man in Athens, fretted about how little he knew.

They even, if you remember from the first episode, have a fancy name for the study of knowledge, epistemology that were false really got Descartes to think in, because when he believed those things, he didn't realize they were false. So what if some of the things he still believed were also false and he just hadn't realized it yet? How could he know that his beliefs were true? Well, after a bit of a freak-out, Descartes realized that the only way to make sure he wasn't holding any false beliefs was to disbelieve everything, at least temporarily. He offered this as an analogy. Imagine you have a basket tricks on you and you've just tapped on the shoulder of a perfect stranger. Food tastes wrong when you're sick. Drink too much and you feel like the room is spinning. Water that's room temperature feels hot when you come inside after playing in the snow. The list goes on. You can probably think of countless times where your senses gave you faulty information. And once you realize that, how can you ever trust your senses again? And for Des in time, step out of that point and you can check to determine if you've been deceived. But what if everything is a deception? What if everyone is experiencing the same false reality from birth until death? What if nothing is as it seems, just like in the Matrix?

And one of his most clear thoughts, what he called a clear and distinct idea, was that God exists. He gave an argument for this, which we're going to examine in a later episode.

So if everything about Phineas' personality could be explained in terms of his brain, it's no shock that a radical change in his brain would bring about a radical change in his personality. The same belief is at. When I make up my mind to do something, I have the power to compel my body to do as I please, to get up off the couch and make myself a nice PD&J, for example. What's more, my mental states seem to have the ability to affect my physical states, even against my will. You ever notice how many people who are grieving or under a lot of stress, for example, often get physically sick. Likewise, our bodies also appear to be able to affect our minds. Like, when you're so hungry the mind and the body. But that really only pushes the problem back without solving it, since the pineal gland is part of the physical body. Many modern philosophers of mind, seeing no way to solve the mind-body problem, have felt compelled to abandon substance dualism altogether. Some are happy to be physicalists, but others are convinced that there are some parts of the human experience that simply can't be boiled down to brains. To see what they think is being left out, let's head over to, Thought Bubble. What's missing from a physicalist account, many argue, is what are known as qualia, instances of subjective first-person experience. Qualia are what it feels like to stub your toe, or take the first bite out of a slice of pizza, or to learn that you have been deeply betrayed by a trusted friend. It's what Mary is said to gain when she steps out of the room and sees color for the first time. Physicalists respond to thought experiments like Jackson's by arguing that they beg the states. So by this thinking, your beliefs, desires, and temperaments do exist, but they have no power over anything physical about you. Which might sound kind of weird and unconvincing. But then there's contemporary British philosopher Colin McGinn, who advocates for a view called Mysterianism. This says, the question of consciousness is unsolvable by human minds. It's not that McGinn thinks we're dummies. He thinks humans are natural knowers, just gives a problem, and your mind to figure out. Today we talked about theories of where the mind resides.

They choose to give up one or more divine attributes. They argue that maybe God isn't powerful enough to stop evil, or maybe he's not knowledgeable enough to know about it, or maybe he's not even good enough to care about stopping it. That might sound weird to some of you, but if you've ever heard someone say that God is envious or petty or jealous, that's basically what they're doing. They're acknowledging the possibility that God is not actually good. If you've ever checked out the Old although he does know about evil and could stop it, he has a good reason not to. To ensure our freedom. The problem is, the free will defense only really addresses what's known as moral evil, or the evil committed on purpose by humans. Now we're certainly responsible for a lot of bad stuff, but you can't blame us for everything. We can't be held responsible for the fact that the plates of the Earth sometimes shift, causing destructive earthquakes, Ivan wants nothing to do with it.

A lot of people find these and other theodices to be pretty goal.

They have more substance, they occupy an extra dimension. Think about how that would feel to suddenly realize that everything you believed just minutes ago turned out to be merely faint outlines of reality. This is what happens to a lot of the characters who inhabit the world of inception.. That one day you went to a zoo or a wildlife refuge or a national park and you saw an actual bear. And suddenly you realized that your previous understanding of bear was way off. Bears don't have little button eyes and smiles made of thread. They're not soft. You couldn't hug one. The bear you spent your first years of life snuggling with was most real is actually a mere shadow of a higher truth.

The naive understanding of what words mean is just that they're whatever the dictionary says. But we know that's not totally true. Think about the difference between words like cat, kitty, mouser, and feline. Early 20th century German philosopher Gottlob Frigge helped parse out this difference by drawing a distinction between what he called sense become citizens. The long-standing view of definitions was that if you configure out both the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be X, then you'll have your definition. That is, you'll have found the criteria that exclude all non-Xs but include all Xs. If you're following me. But 20th century Austrian British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said this rigid concept of definitions doesn't actually work. For example, you just can't define the word game in a way that's gonna make everybody dad's athleticism, you and your sister don't really have much in common, but you do both resemble your parents. But it's not like every concept in the cluster is equal. The ones that everyone would accept are the paradigm cases. You can picture them in the center of the cluster. And as you move to the outer edges, you'll get fringe cases. The ones that some people would include in the group, but others would exclude. Everyone will agree that football is a game, but there's gonna be some disagreement about things like, I don could be at a club, and one of you would say to the other, that guy at the bar is a total shoehorn, and the other one would know exactly what you meant. In that case, do those words that have meaning specific to the two of you really mean what you say they mean even if no one else agrees with you? And what happens if the two of you forget that meaning? Is the meaning still there? Or does it only exist as long as someone uses the word that way? That's bounce over to the thought bubble for a bit what's inside. But here's the thing, it doesn't matter because beetle just means what's in the box. It could literally be a beetle or it could be a fox in socks. The point is we don't know if the color red in my mind is the same as the color red in your mind because the color red is a beetle in a box. It's a label for what's in our minds. So language, Wittgenstein said, can't refer as anyone who's ever, like, had a conversation, knows, this doesn't always work out. Like, Billy tells Bobby that he likes Sally. Billy, the speaker, means that he likes Sally as a friend. Bobby, the audience, takes Billy's statement to be a profession of, like, you know, like, like. So Bobby then goes and tells Sally that Billy liked like, sir, when in fact Billy actually likes like, Susie, not Sally, and pretty soon, you know, goes, tears.\", 'Philosophy'], [\" It's your funeral. No, I'm actually, you're dead. Your loved ones are all sitting around reminiscing about your life. What are they saying? How will you be remembered? Did you have a good life? How would we know? What constitutes a good life? The first thing to consider is whether the value of a life is determined by the liver of that life or by other people. What if your last thought before you died was that you would have had a perfect life? But when your loved ones sit around and discuss it, they all decide, you've probably heard of it. Due to various transgressions he'd committed, Sisyphus was condemned by the gods to roll a boulder up a mountain. And when he reached the top, the boulder would roll back down and then Sisyphus would have to start all over again. This was the entirety of his existence. He couldn't do anything else. It was just up and down the hill in a never-ending cycle. And you know what Kemu said about that? He said, we must imagine Sisyphus happy. Really? Happy? Well's meaning making for you. The existentialist message is that your life is in your hands. You and only you have the power to make your life great, and only you can evaluate its greatness. Contemporary American philosopher Joanne Chula encourages you to think about the philosophy of your work. She reminds us that for most of your life, you're going to spend more of your waking hours at work than anywhere else. So find a job you love. If you don't love it, There will be no way to tell it's a simulation. Now, Nozick had no interest in entering such a machine, and he thought that most of us wouldn't either, because the experiences it gives us don't correspond with reality. Even though you might feel like you're having meaningful relationships in the machine, in the actual world, those people would be out living their own lives without you while you're laying in bed having a life of flourishing, a life in which a person is constantly striving for self-improvement to be more virtuous, more wise, more thoughtful, and self-aware, better. This was Aristotle's idea of a life well lived. He wouldn't agree with Camus that we all get to make our own meaning and that there are infinite ways to live a good life, and he certainly wouldn't endorse the use of the same questions that were first posed 2500 years ago. And now, 46 episodes later, you can see that they are still disagreeing with each other. But at this point, hopefully you see that all of the questioning and disagreeing isn't some character flaw that all philosophers have. It in itself is a deliberate, chosen way to live, no matter what kind of philosophy they prefer. Some philosophers are theists and others are atheists. They're dualists and because philosophy teaches you to be creative, flexible, and holistic in your vision and thinking. To live as a philosopher means to never stop questioning and to never stop striving for truth, to continue working to live better, to know more, and to revise your position based on new evidence.

It, subsistence, subsistence, and existence. And he posited that even non-existent things could fit into this system. First, he said, every possible object that you can think of, absists. If you can think about it, it has absists. This includes stuff that could never exist in real life, like unicorns or the mythical lost island that our old monk friend, Guanello, said would be the best place on Earth, if it were possible. And inside the group might think that Harry Potter is real, in some sense. Like you get that he's fictional, but to you, he feels real. So what about that? Is that nonsense, too? Not necessarily. Here's one way that some estheticians, or philosophers of art, make sense of what's going on when we talk about fictional objects. They begin by pointing out where, metaphorically speaking, we talk about them. The domain in which we have a conversation is known as a universe of discourse, and inside this universe, assertions can be either true or false. And that universe shares some things in common with our world, but it has differences too. In the real world, it is false that Harry Potter has a lightning scar on his head because there is no Harry Potter. But in the universe of discourse that is the world of Harry Potter, it's true because both Harry and his lightning scar exist. So when we talk about fiction, we're speaking within a particular universe of discourse, and our interlocutors know this, even if it's not explicitly stated. This lets us say things that end up being true, even though the truth doesn't track, in a world where both ghosts and zombies exist, would it be possible for one person to become both at death? Our ability to understand and play around with fictional realities helps us think about other hypothetical realities too, like what will happen in the future and what the implications might be of different choices that we make. So treating non-existent things as if they're real, nonsense probably isn't the right word for it. Being able to create and conceptualize a universe is a pretty amazing skill.\", 'Philosophy'], [\" For most of you, your parents brought you into this world. They also fed you and changed your diapers and wiped away your tears. They raised you. Yet, according to contemporary American philosopher Jane English, once you're grown, you don't owe your parents anything. Not a single thing. Now this might sound a little selfish, a little ungrateful, a little mean. But let's hear her out. Because you've learned by now that many of your default attitudes, the amount of benefit that you received growing up. And finally, there's English's view known as the friendship view. This says that you don't actually owe your parents anything once you've grown, regardless of how much you benefited from their parenting. Many of us take it as basic, that we owe our parents a lot, what with all of the feeding and nurturing and driving the soccer games and acting like they enjoyed our macaroni art. But English makes a couple growing up don't count because back when the relationship started, you were just a baby and you didn't have the rational capacity to be held to a moral contract. And what's more, your parents didn't provide for you with the expectation of a payout. They had you or they kept you or adopted you because they wanted you and they gave to you because they wanted to. Good parents give unconditionally, so no matter how much you receive from them, you simply don't incur debt because that's not how family you. Now this attitude might seem scandalous to some people. I mean, isn't blood thicker than water? Well, many philosophers challenge the idea that you have special obligations to someone just because you share some genetic material with them. By that logic, a person who was adopted at birth would have obligations to biological relatives that they've never met, and they wouldn't have any obligations to the family that raised them. And I think most of us can agree that that doesn't make any sense. We tend to think of adopted families as being no less familial than biological families a kid if you do it badly. But right now, we wait until a parent has abused or neglected a child before the state intervenes, so Luffalet asks, wouldn't it be better if we took preventative measures instead? After all, adoptive parents undergo heavy scrutiny before they get to have kids. So, just like driving a car in Luffalet's plan, you'd have to pass a test before you could get a parenting license. There'd be classes for those who need it, and you those changes happened. And even if you aren't really that person anymore, that connection can be grounding and valuable.

If those properties were missing, then that thing would be a different thing. For instance, a knife could have a wooden handle or a metal handle. It really doesn't matter. But if it didn't have a blade, it wouldn't really be a knife anymore. The blade is the essential property of the knife because it gives the knife its defining function. Now, Plato and Aristotle thought that everything has an essence, existentialism, and its mantra is the claim that existence precedes essence. In other words, our existence, our birth, happens first, then it's up to each of us to determine who we are. We have to write our own essence through the way we choose to live. But we have no actual predetermined purpose. There's no set path that we're supposed to follow. It's hard to express how radical this idea was at the time. Because for thousands of years before this, you didn't have to choose a path or find your purpose, but we keep crying anyway. That, for an existentialist, is the definition of absurd. Since there's no teleology, the world wasn't created for a reason, and it doesn't exist for a reason. And if there's no reason for any of this, then there's also no absolutes to abide by. There's no cosmic justice, no fairness, no order, no rules live authentically. Sartre used this to mean that you have to accept the full weight of your freedom in light of the absurd. You have to recognize that any meaning your life has is given to it by you. And if you decide to just phone it in and follow a path that someone else has set, whether it's your teachers, your government, or your religion, then you have just one person's life. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So what's the answer? Sartre said, the whole point of this young man's decision was that no one could give him an answer. In fact, there was no answer until the man chose one for himself. No moral theory could help him decide, because no one else's advice could lead him to a decision that was truly authentic. So his choice, no matter what it was, was the only true choice and his ideas about how to find meaning in a meaningless world. This episode was brought to you by Squarespace.

They die because they don't have enough to eat. They die of malaria or of intestinal worms, something we don't even let our pets suffer from. It's a horrifying truth, and what's maybe even more horrifying is that these deaths are easily preventable. For $3 a child could get a mosquito net for her bed that would protect her from malaria. To cure her of intestinal do, it's much, much less than the obligation we have to those who are near and dear to us. So many people argue that we simply don't have any obligation to help strangers in need. We didn't make them poor and we never agreed to help them, so if we do choose to help, that's great. But such actions are super-irrogatory. They go above and beyond the call of moral duty. In this view, giving money to charity is like getting moral extra credit. If you do it, you can go ahead and pat yourself on the back, but if you don't, you have not to save the child. Singer says it comes down to costs and benefits. The cost of your shoes is so low compared to the value of the child's life that it would be appalling not to make that sacrifice, to value shoes over a person's life. But here's the thing. We know children are dying right now, 12 every minute, and yet we do nothing. So what's the difference, Singer asks, between a life in front of us and a life halfway around the world? A life is a life in both of you and of your actions. So if you see a need and you know you can help, you must, even if there are others who could, but don't. Now, is it fair for you to have to bear the burden of helping while others sit idly they're gonna make it. Helping a few of them out doesn't really solve any problems. If anything, it draws out their suffering. Okay, here's the thing about this analogy. The lucky people in counterintuitively, Harden said the most compassionate response is to do nothing. Yes, people will die, but if aid were to stop, Harden said, populations would be reduced to a point where nations would be able to sustain themselves. Now, there are at least two pretty immediate responses to this line of thinking. First, the life-put analogy breaks down when you realize that the problem really has nothing to do with the scarcity of resources. In the real world, there are plenty of resources to go around, and they're just distributed. But today, we talked about extreme poverty and our responses to it. We considered Singer's argument that we have an obligation to prevent harm through poverty when we can, and we also looked at Harden's life mode analogy.

Let's say for the sake of argument that you love your father, by which I mean you want him to be alive. And let's also assume that you don't have any attachments to your mother that you might describe as romantic. Well guess who thought he felt the same way about his parents, Edipus. According to ancient Greek legend, when Edipus was born, a of us have the clear sense that we are. We feel free. We feel like we make all sorts of decisions that lead to both beliefs and actions that are wholly of our own choosing, like... I otherwise. So truly free actions require options. Determinism, by contrast, doesn't allow options. It holds that every event is caused by a previous event, which means that an agent can can make stuff happen on their own. But many philosophers find this idea untenable. Where would these free decisions, the ones that launch entirely new causal chains, come from, they ask? Are they simply random? What would compel bats hitting balls or tornadoes are caused by warm air systems hitting cool air systems in the right conditions. This means that humans and our actions are just part of the physical world, bound by its physical laws. This belief is often explained through a view known as reductionism. Reductionism is the view that all parts of the world and of our own experience can be traced back or reduced down to one singular thing. So, when beliefs team up with our desires and our temperament, they say, you get a deliberate human action. Combine my belief that oatmeal is nutritious with my desire for healthy nourishment and the temperament that predisposes me to enjoy warm, carby comfort foods and ta-da. You get oatmealy breakfast. Now, you might argue that those particular beliefs, desires, and temperaments might lead to any number of breakfast choices, cream of wheat, maybe, or some granola. But if you dig deep enough, you'd find't there some way out of this? Like, what if I have someone choose my breakfast for me? Or what if I fall back on randomness by like flipping a coin? After all, if I just flipped a coin, then it wouldn't look like that decision was made by belief's desires and temperaments. But, well, no such luck. Because even if I thought I chose randomly my decision to flip the coin, or who I asked to pick for me was just as determined as everything else. And guess what? If you're getting angry right now couldn't turn away. Today, we learned about libertarian free will and its counterpoint hard to determinism.

Are they still people? What about, if you encountered Superman on another planet, the question wouldn't even cross your mind. The way he acts and talks certainly indicates that he's a person. But soops definitely isn't human. But is it possible to be human? Yet not a person. Some people believe that fetuses, though clearly human, are not yet persons. Others think that bodies in persistent vegetative states, or that have experienced a complete and irreversible loss of brain function, are no longer persons either. Still, others argue that a human can persons than like, you know, some of my cells. But American philosopher Mary Ann Warren offers five more specific criteria that she believes together constitute personhood. Consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity, capacity to communicate, and self-awareness. These five factors are known as the cognitive criteria for personhood. Warren argues that some humans just aren't persons, it also means that if no one happens to care for a particular being, that being simply isn't a person. It would mean that fully rational, healthy, functioning adult humans might not have personhood just because no one happens to care about them. And we probably want inclusion in our moral community to be something more than a popularity contest. So then there's contemporary Australian moral philosopher Peter Singer, who says that the key to personhood, so we, as members of the state, would think ourselves justified in killing them. Now, so far we've been talking about personhood like it's a toggle switch. You have it, or you don't. But a more nuanced option is the gradient theory of personhood, which says it's not all or nothing. It's more like a dimmer switch. So, personhood comes in degrees, and you can several criteria, genetic, cognitive, social, sentience, and the gradient theory for determining what constitutes personhood, and we explored how the definition of personhood informs some important social debates.

Let's go over to the Thought Bubble and explore the ideas of our bodies and ourselves with some flash philosophy. 20th century when we wake up, our conscious selves remember who we were the day before. So Locke posited a memory theory of personal identity. He believed that your identity persists over time because you retain memories of yourself at different points, and each of those memories is connected to one before it. Now, we don't remember every single moment. I mean, do you remember what you ate for lunch last Tuesday? But you can probably remember a couple of years at the beginning. What's more, if you're committed to this view, you have to accept that people stop being the same person if they lose their memories. So, say a person begins to suffer from dementia. Once he's lost the ability to remember his past, does he stop being that person? So the memory theory presents problems for both the beginnings and ends of life, but there's also the issue of false memories. Memory, after all, is notoriously tricky. We know that a group of eyewitnesses are likely to recount the same event very how people think about you. Your boss only has to give you the raise, she promised, you if each of you remains the same person you were when she made the promise. In fact, if next Friday you're not the same person anymore, she doesn't even have to pay you. The fact is, we've all built our lives and our society on the expectations that individuals will continue to be who they are unchanged, and those people expect the same thing out of you.

If Leibniz is right, then the ship of Theseus became a new ship as soon as that first plank of wood was replaced. As soon as its parts were not all original, then the ship suddenly acquired a new property, and with a new property, came a new identity. So likewise, Bruce Wayne and Batman can't be identical because they of what it means to be Goliath is to be shaped like a statue. But Goliath being a lump doesn't have a set shape, so it happen when the tree was cut into pieces and was lying on the ground? Did it make a difference when those pieces were collected? How about when they were ground up into pulp? The tree stopped being a tree when its essential property was lost, but when exactly that happened, it depends on your perspective.

Is he a he? Is he like strictly Marvel superheroes or is he more of a DC guy? Does he prefer his salsa with or without cilantro. And he's omnipemporal and omnipresent, meaning he exists at all places and all times at once. Now, it's worth noting that none of these attributes is actually mentioned in the Bible. But philosophers like Aquinas reasoned that they must be the case if God is perfect, and these philosophers took it as given that he is. The problem is a close investigation of these attributes reveals some rather in the past. And don't forget the present. But many theists also believe that God gave us free will. So how can we be free if God already knows what we're gonna do? In that case, are we really free, or is freedom just an illusion that he created for us to make us feel like we're in control? What we're seeing here is that, at least on the surface, God's traditional divine attributes are internally inconsistent, meaning they can't all be true at the same time. And what do you do if you hold inconsistent beliefs? Well, if you knew you were going to eat an entire pecan pie by yourself over the course of a lonely weekend, that doesn't mean that he caused you to do it. That was all on you. But wait, if God is omniscient, then he can't be wrong, can he? Because if he was ever wrong, then there would have been something he didn't know. So if God knew you were going to eat the whole pie, then you couldn't not eat the pie, because if you decided not to at the last minute, then you would inherently good. Now, many philosophers find this solution troubling because it kind of makes God's goodness vacuous. After all, it basically means that saying God did a thing would be the same thing as saying God did a good thing, because if so facto, anything God does is good. And if that's the case, then his goodness doesn't have any real meaning. Yet another possible contradiction presents itself in the belief that wants to bring about the best state of affairs, which he does if he's omnibenevolent, then God has already decided what's going to happen in every single case to everyone always. So either your prayer is asking God to do something he was already going to do, in which case your prayer was kind of a waste of time, or your prayer is asking God to it this way, people in South Florida might say it's cold when the temperature dips into the 50s, but in Alaska it's not cold until it's well below zero.

You might even say that absolute zero cold and negative 10 degrees cold. That's the kind of stuff that we, as philosophers, get to ponder. Kindly and thoughtfully in the comments.

Yeah, the Italian fella, Christian monk, philosophical superstar of the 13th century. Aquinas thought morality was important for everyone and that being a good person was a vital part of God's plan for each of us. But he also knew that not everyone had been exposed to the Bible or had even heard of God. So what bothered him was, how could people follow God's moral rules, also known as the divine commands, if they didn't even know about the guy who made the commandments? Aquinas got that, and he said that it was okay. In fact, the theory of natural law is based on the idea that God wants us to want things, specifically good things. Aquinas argued that God created the world according to natural laws, predictable, goal-driven systems whereby life is sustained and everything functions smoothly. And as part of this natural order, God made certain things we manage to achieve our second basic good reproduction, we need to educate those kids we just made. For humans, that's gonna need stuff like school and lessons and morality. But even non-human animals need to teach their babies how to hunt and avoid predators. Otherwise, the offspring they work so hard to guilt when we do things that cause our group to turn against us, and that was another basic good. And finally, Aquinas said, we're built to shun ignorance. We're natural knowers. We're inquisitive, and we want to be right. This is another trait that we share with non-human animals, because knowledge promotes survival, and ignorance can mean healthy choices for myself. And we can do the same with each of the basic goods. The basic good of reproduction leads to a prohibition. Don't prevent reproduction, which is why the Catholic Church has been opposed to birth control. And the positive injunction there is do procreate, do all the procreate and you want. And if you think it through using and we fail to do the things we know we should. So in those cases, we just kind of forget to be awesome. Now, as with the Divine Command Theory, natural law gives us a handy answer to the grounding problem. It and conclude that reproduction is good, but sexual drive is also used by bad people to excuse horrible, immoral things like committing sexual assault.

Now, whether psychology today is considered a hard science, or a social science, or some other kind might be debatable, but you won't find many mainstream thinkers who consider it pseudoscience. But still, nearly 100 years ago, when Popper was reaching these conclusions, no modern philosopher had really characterized what science truly meant, and'm gonna find it easily. The world is filthy with evidence of Santa Claus. They're present under the tree on Christmas morning, there's the guy at the mall, and then there are all those songs and stories and TV shows and movies they combine to confirm your belief in Santa. But Popper would argue that it's only by seeking to disprove Santa's existence that you can demonstrate his unreality. So the question is, when we begin to test for Santa's reality, your method would require you to try to prove that he doesn't exist, rather than proving that he does. So you stay up all night waiting to catch him delivering his presence. This is risky, because if the person who actually shows up to put present under the tree is your dad, then you've destroyed the Santa hypothesis. On a very similar note, Popper also pointed out that irrefutable theories are not scientific. If it can't be tested, then your theory doesn't have much value. Like, you can only confirm that Santa is real by this might seem so obvious that maybe you're wondering why we're even talking about it. But that's how Wright Popper was. He was one of those rare philosophers who actually managed to hit on an idea so right that we don't even really argue about it anymore. So it sounds like I've been talking mainly about science all this time, but Popper and his insights also tell us a lot about knowledge in the philosophical sense. For Popper, knowledge was about probability and contingency. We are justified in believing whatever seems most probable given our current data. that is hardest for most people, God.

The response to the lion's death was so strong that the guy who shot Cecil basically went into hiding until he issued an apology. But isn't that a little bit strange? We react with horror when we hear of a piece of standard printer paper. Their beaks are often cut down to keep them from pecking each other, and when they're no longer laying enough eggs, they're killed. These are just a couple examples of the conditions animals experience at our expense, and they're not unusual. We'd never dream of using another human being in these ways, but we think nothing of doing it to non-human animals in ways that we would never subject humans to. One arbiter you might use to justify the difference is intelligence. There's no question that as a species, our intelligence trumps that of every other species on the planet. But we don't normally think that intelligence is a good way for deciding how you get treated. Dystopian novels like Brave New World bring out the visceral distaste we have for that kind of intelligence-based certainly not be okay with it if you weren't a member of the privileged species. Remember, this is the exact argument that was given by slave owners to justify their domination of Africans and indigenous peoples. So if you don't normally think Mike makes right, then wouldn't it be hypocritical to use it as a justification in this case? Yet another rationale is that this is the way it's always been. And it's true, humans have been dominating non-human animals for a really an equal consideration of interests. This means that identical interests should be given equal weight, regardless of what type of being they occur in. Of course, humans have all sorts of interests that animals don't have. Some of us have interests in going to college and voting and getting married. And non-human animals don't have an interest at doing those things, so we don't have any obligation to help them do that stuff. But there is that for most people in the industrialized world today, it's not about need. It's simply about taste and convenience and how things have always been done.

Philosophers want you to be able to justify your actions, to give reasons for what you do.

Rule number one, he must shave all men who do not shave themselves. Rule number two, he must notises form the structure of your argument. They offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like as long as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe. So let's dissect the anatomy of an argument. There are actually several different species of conclusion, which leads us to another issue, and that is, validity is not the same as truth. All valid really means is that if the premises are true, then your conclusion can't be false. But that doesn't mean that your premises prove your conclusion to be correct. Like in the case of whether Socrates was Plato's teacher, the premises are true, and the conclusion is bathing suit, this argument is not deductively sound. And a deductively sound argument is one that's free of formal flaws or defects. It's an argument whose premises are all true, and that's valid, which means its conclusion is guaranteed to be true. So, sound arguments should always be your goal. The reason that deduction is prized by philosophers and lots of other important kinds of thinkers is that it's the only kind of argument that can give you a real certainty. But it's limited, because it only works if you're starting with known, true premises, which are hard to come by.

Reasoning like this is incredibly useful, which is why it's so common, but there's also a problem. The future doesn't always resemble the past, and every pattern has its outliers.

If that's the case, then Grace said, you are adhering to what's known as the cooperative principle. This means that whenever there's ambiguity in what a speaker is saying, the audience should look for the most likely intended meaning of what's being said, given the context. So even if the literal words don't fit into the conversation you're having, you should try to interpret whatever your interlocutor is saying so that it makes sense. Like, if you're in your sister's room having an First, we shouldn't say things that we think are false. This includes people who are running for elected office. No one should just tell lies.

Is there such a thing as a good lie? Questions like these are the domain of ethics, the branch of philosophy that studies morality, or right and wrong behavior. But before we can parse questions like these, we need to go deeper into metaethics, which studies the very foundations of morality itself. Metaethics asks questions as basic as what is's just head straight over to the Thought Bubble for some flash philosophy. A burglar plots to break into an old woman's house on a Sunday morning, a time when he knows she's always at church. So, one Sunday, he creeps up to her back window and smashes it with a hammer. But after he looks inside, he sees the old woman isn't at church. She's in there, laying face down on the floor. The side of her body scares the burglar there are scientific facts. In this view, any moral proposition can only be true or false. And for a lot of us, our gut intuition tells us that there are moral facts. Some things are just wrong and others are indisputably right. Like, a lot of people think that gratuitous violence is always wrong and nurturing children is always right, no matter what. But you don't have to dig very deep into moral realism before you run into trouble to some form of moral realism, and there are many forms. So, let's familiarize ourselves with some of its most popular flavors. Some moral realists are moral absolutists. Not only do they believe in moral facts, they believe that there are some moral facts that don't change. So for them, if something is wrong, it's wrong regardless of culture or circumstance. differs based on culture. Now, normative cultural relativism might sound pretty good to you. It does, at first, to a lot of people. Because it seems like it's all about inclusiveness and tolerance. Who am I to tell other cultures how they should live, right? But this view actually has some pretty big flaws. If every culture is the sole arbiter of what's right for it, that means no culture can actually be wrong. It means's unjust. But it doesn't go any deeper than that. There are no moral facts, only moral attitudes. There are other varieties of both moral realism and anti-realism, but this should give you an idea of the general meta-ethical lay of the land.

And true, it might be bad after it's over, like if it kept you from doing well in the calculus exam the next morning because you were too busy trying not to barf in front of said cutie.

By the time we're done today, I just might have you questioning whether this apple is real or not. Think I can't do it? Give me about ten minutes. I might have you wondering whether I'm a physical object or not. And the same goes for all this stuff. And for your computer and Nick behind the camera. And you. How? By unleashing the power of philosophers disagreed. They argued that thinking on its own wasn't enough. Like, just because you're thinking doesn't mean that your thoughts correspond to material reality in any reliable way. Basically, Descartes' philosophical opponents thought that the cogito was a dead end. So here we start to see a split between two different understandings of how we can most reliably get English thinker John Locke. This is where he was born. Locke believed that we are all born as tabularaza, or a blank slate. He argued that all knowledge is obtained through experience. He rejected the concept of innate ideas, the view that we are born preloaded with certain information, like what's good versus what's bad, or what is the nature of God. stationary or in motion. So primary qualities, Locke said, belong to the thing itself. Think this apple. It weighs maybe 150 grams. It's the size of my palm, roundish, but firm with the slightest bit of give, and right now it's moving through the air. Those are its primary qualities. But it has secondary qualities too, and by Locke's standards they are not real, at least not in the objective agreed upon way. They're just in our minds, but everything to do with the object itself. Locke's reasoning was simple, even elegant, extracting a lot of explanatory power out of very few basic concepts. As a result, it resonated with a lot of people. And one person it resonated strongly with was the Irish philosopher George Berkeley. He was moved by Locke's empiricism and took it seriously. So texture, you'll find that there's still texture there. It's just smooth. Remember, Locke asserted that secondary qualities are not objectively real. They can only be subjectively perceived. But now, Berkeley has shown that the two are inextricably linked. You can't have one without the other. Which means that the primary qualities can't be real either. They, too, are just you'll continue to exist in your sleep is to have a friend watch you when you're sleeping, which probably is a non-starter for a number of reasons. But in any case, the second your friend blinks! You're gone! So in the end, Berkeley believed that there was only one thing that kept us and everything else from disappearing into oblivion. God. Berkeley believed that God was the ultimate perceiver. God is always watching with unblinking perception that holds objects in existence even when we're not paying attention.\", 'Philosophy'], [\" Should Batman kill the Joker? If you were to ask the Dark Knight himself with his hard and fast no killing rule, he'd say absolutely not. Actually, in fact, he would say, absolutely not. When you think about it, dude is pretty Kantian in his ethics. Regardless of what Joker does, there are some lines that good people do not cross, and for Batman, killing definitely falls on the wrong side of that line. But precisely, it's absolute. Kantianism is all about sticking to the moral rule book. There are never any exceptions or any excuses for violating moral rules. And our man, Batman, tries his hardest to stick to his code, no matter what. But there are other ways of looking at ethics. Like, instead of focusing on the intent behind our behavior, what if we paid more I think it will make me happy. That's what we all want. It's one of the few things everyone has in common. And utilitarians believe that's what should drive our morality. Like Cott, utilitarians agree that a moral theory should apply equally to everyone, but they thought the way to do that was to ground it in something that's really intuitive, and there's really nothing more basic than the primal desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain. So it's your birthday and your family says you can choose any restaurant you want. The thing that would make you happiest is Thai food, but you know that that would make the rest of your family miserable. So when you choose Chinese, which is nobody's favorite, but everybody can make do, then you've thought like a utilitarian. You've chosen the action that would produce the most overall happiness for the group, even though it produced less happiness for you than other alternatives would have. The problem is, for the most part,, to see utilitarianism put to the test, let's pop over to the Thought Bubble for some flash philosophy. 20th century British philosopher Bernard Williams offered this thought experiment. Jim is on a botanical expedition in South America when he happens upon a group of 20 indigenous people and the group of soldiers. The whole group of indigenous people is about to be executed for protesting their oppressive regime to make things better, we must, even if that means getting our hands dirty. And if I sit by and watch something bad happen when I could have prevented it, my hands are dirty anyway. So Jim shouldn't think about it as killing one man. That man was dead already because they were all about to be killed. Instead, Jim should think of his decision as doing what it takes to save my team. And Batman needs to kill the greatest number. Yes, one innocent person dies, but five innocent people are saved. This might seem harsh, but remember that pain is pain regardless of who's experiencing it. So the death of the neighbor would be no worse than the death of any of those patients dying on the transplant list.

And that raises a few questions. For example, many observant Jews follow the rule about not wearing wool mixed with linen, but Christians don't. Most of them probably don't even know that that rule exists. And yet, they is set outside of the Athenian courthouse as the two men sit awaiting their respective trials. Socrates is preparing to defend himself against the charges that will ultimately lead to his death. Among other things, he was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens and not having the right kinds of beliefs about the gods. Meanwhile, Yuthafro is getting ready to bring murder charges against his very own father. Socrates're accepting the proposition that right acts are right because God commands them. And this means that you're accepting that God's command alone is simply what makes something right. So in this view, God makes goodness, and by extension, this suggests that anything God commands is right. And maybe you're okay with that because you believe God only commands good things, like honoring your parents and not stealing or lying or killing. But those of you who God says, he understands that this is confusing, but he assures you that he knows best, and this has been part of his plan all along. He was just waiting for humanity to be ready for it. So he instructs you to go forth and begin carrying out his commands, to do otherwise would be a sin. So how do you process this information? Do you assume that there must be something wrong with your brain, or that something's gone wrong with God, or do you obey? Thanks Thought Bubble.. If there's some standard of goodness that God has to stick to when making commandments, then that means there must be things that God can't command. And if the ethical rules of the universe come from some source other than God, then why can't we just go straight to that source too and figure out morality for ourselves in the same way God did approaches things from a theistic perspective, but is immune to some of these problems.

It's gonna be hard and enlightening and scientific, although they didn't really have the concept of science back then. So, philosophy, literally the love of wisdom, was a new way of trying to make sense of the world. When the earliest philosophers used the word philosophy, they basically meant the academic study of anything, which I guess could include golf. But at what we might call the first universities in the Western world, Plato's Academy and its rival Aristotle's, is the world just made up of matter and energy, or is there something else going on? And if it is just matter and energy, then where did it all come from? Is there a god? And if so, then what is he or she or it like? For that matter, when you're asking about the world, can you also be asking about the nature of yourself as a citizen of the world? So, what kind of being am I? Do I ever be certain about anything? Now, at this point, I wouldn't blame you if you're thinking, am I real? Do I know anything? Well, as questions go, these might not seem super practical. But there's another area of philosophy that helps frame your thinking around what you actually do, like how you should whether it even exists. Aesthetics is a part of value theory because beauty and art are things we value and evaluate. And many people who study this particular kind of philosophy, known as estheticians, believe there is such a thing as the beautiful. Something that doesn't just depend on what you happen to find attractive, but something that's just objectively true. And finally, there why you value it, and what you should do about it. So here's our plan. We're gonna learn about the major fields of philosophy posing questions and considering possible answers along the way, and each time we will use a two-step method. First, we'll really try to understand. You're not gonna agree with all the ideas that I present to you, and I won't agree with them either. That's not the point. The point in step one is to really try to get inside of an idea, to understand it as charitablying questions. And that is where we're going to be headed the next time we meet. For now, you've learned about the historical origins of philosophy in ancient Greece and its three main divisions, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We also talk about logic and how you're going to use it to understand and critically evaluate the whole host of different worldviews. Not about golf.

But he made a distinction between the things we ought to do morally, and the things we ought to do for other non-moral reasons. He pointed out that most of the time, whether or not we ought to do something isn't really a moral choice. Instead, it's just contingent on our desires. Like, if your desire is to get money, moral? Kant said the categorical imperative can be understood in terms of various formulations, basically different ways of phrasing or looking at the same essential idea. And he came up with four formulations of the categorical imperative. Let me tell you about the two most popular ones. The first formulation of the categorical imperative is often known as the universalizability principle. And Kant phrased it this way, act only according to that maxim, which you approve of the maximum stealing, which you're doing, whether you admit it or not, then what you're actually doing is universalizing that action. You're saying that everyone should always steal. If you should be able to do it, then everyone should be able to do it. The thing is, this leads to a contradiction. And remember, Consuarting specifically says that moral actions cannot bring about contradictions. The contradiction here is no one would say that everyone should steal all the time. Because if everyone should always steal, then you talking to the stranger. At the time, she thinks Tony's in the kitchen where she left him. But it turns out that he was curious about the collar, so he followed her into the living room and heard the stranger make his threats. Fearing for his life, Tony slipped out the back door. Meanwhile, Elvira and her desire to save him tells the stranger that Tony isn't there even though she thinks he is. Based on her lie, the stranger leaves and own benefit with no thought to the interests or benefit of the thing you're using. Now we use things as mere means all the time. I use this mug to hold my coffee and if it were to stop benefiting me, like if it got a crack and it started leaking, I wouldn't use it anymore. It's perfectly fine to use things as mere means, but not humans. This is because we are what Kant called ends in ourselves. We are not mere objects that-governed. We're able to set our own ends to make our own free decisions based on our rational wills. We can set goals for ourselves and take steps to realize those goals. This imbues us with an absolute moral worth, Kant said, which means that we shouldn't be manipulated or manipulate other autonomous agents for our own benefit. And this means.

Lykin says Harry's a person. His origin and his material're locked in a room with boxes filled with Chinese characters and a code book in English with instructions about what characters to use in response to what input.

A world where presidential elections hinge on people's views regarding the building of walls. And we should be open about the fact that issues like these, ones that involve our beliefs about same misequality and difference, are sensitive and can easily arouse our emotions. One topic that always comes up in these conversations is discrimination. It's one of those loaded words packed with negativity. Morally relevant differences are things that would actually justify unequal treatment. Like if you work for an airline and you're hiring a pilot, you can favor a person with sight over a blind person because when the job is flying a plane, sight matters. You're not discriminating against a blind person because they're blind, but because they are literally unable to do the job. And someone who looks like me would be a fairly awful candidate to be treated by a qualified gynecologist because he's Asian American? Or say there's an all-male company that hires a qualified woman over an equally qualified man in the interest of fostering diversity in the workplace. Or a bakery that refuses to make a Nazi-themed cake for a customer who's a white supremacist. Some of these cases you probably agree with. Some of them you probably don't. Your gut intuition might be to applaud the bakery for refusing to make held in check. And that means reigning in the freedom to discriminate. Now, there's obviously a lot of disagreementologist cases. Many people's intuition is that women should be able to choose against male gynecologists because being examined by a man in such an intimate way might make a woman feel uncomfortable. Yet, many people might report the same level of discomfort being examined by someone of another race. These cases tug as well. Which is exactly what happened, by and large, when racial discrimination and hiring became illegal. It might seem unfair that a small business owner should have to take on that fight, though. Why is it his job to in any case, or that discrimination should occur when it's done to advantage a historically underprivileged group.

And notice that its parts seem to come together in a particular way in order to accomplish a goal. If so, wouldn't we think that designer. If you accept this analogy, then you agree with Paley that just like the purposefulness of a watch compels I still know it had a creator. Whether or not I understand how it was created is beside the point. Next objection, some parts of nature seem to be without purpose. A blind spot obviously doesn't have any function, and neither do nipples on a man. Clearly's response here was, just because you don't know there's a purpose doesn't mean there isn't one. But this is a problem, too, because his whole argument for believing in God is that you should look at the world and see purpose. So the counter argument here is we don't just get to pick and choose and say God designed the stuff we want him to have designed and not the other stuff. Rather than couple of modern responses. Contemporary British philosopher Richard Swinburne gives us a modern tele only have a sample set of one. If we had multiple Earths that we could examine, we could see how likely any particular adaptation is or how unique the conditions for life are. Then we would know if it were likely or unlikely to happen without God. But we can't know that, at least not now, because we can only access this one world where we know that things evolved as they did. Thus, the counter-argument goes, Swinburne and other modern teleologists are right to recognize that if things were slightly different than life maybe\", 'Philosophy'], [\" Justice is one of those things that people talk about all the time without really being specific about what they mean. Activists talk about economic justice, police and lawyers talk about criminal justice, parents, teachers and students talk about justice a lot too, though they may never use that word.

And we the end, what justice means to you personally if that's how you look at things, then you probably espouse some kind of merit-based justice, which says that justice actually means giving unequally based on what each person deserves. And you deserve stuff, or don't, based on what you've done. So this view rewards hard work and punishes troublemakers. Finally, there's the very simple-sounding approach advanced by 20th century American political philosopher John Rawls. He argued that justice is fairness. will explore in the Thought Bubble with some flash philosophy. People who believe that there are essential human rights, for example, argue that we're simply entitled to have our most basic needs fulfilled, things like having enough to eat and being able to go to the doctors when we're sick. But not everyone believes it's the government's job to provide us with those things if we're not able to get them ourselves. Those people might argue that your rights are negative. A negative right is the right not to be interfered with, not to be stopped from pursuing the things you need. So in this view, I can't prevent also about punishment. Like most subjects, philosophers disagree about the most appropriate way to respond to wrongdoing. One concept is known as retributive justice. This holds that the only way for justice to be satisfied is for a wrongdoer to suffer in proportion to the way he's made others suffer. This is your good old fashioned biblical lie for an eye justice. And in this view, punishmenters are in need of our help, that they don't know any better, and that they need to be cured of some social disease. But another approach to just punishment is deterrence. For eons, people have assumed that punishment prevents a wrongdoer from committing for the crimes, while also discouraging others from breaking the rules. So rather than making a wrongdoer suffer for what they've. Today, we talked about various theories of justice. We talked about just a distribution, and we also considered different approaches to punishment. Next time, we'll talk about discrimination.

But the concept of moral responsibility is reserved for moral agents. That is, those who have the ability to think in terms of right and wrong and to make decisions accordingly. If a coconut falls on my head, it is causally responsible for the love that it gives me. But because it is an unthinking thing, it's not blameworthy in the way that you would be if you deliberately j the pictures were taken. So there's circumstantial luck. This relates to the situation you find yourself in, and plays a huge role in whether you manage to do good or bad things. It's easy to blame the officer in the concentration flat, and awful plans can produce something that's unexpectedly awesome. We don't cheer for the person who fails to save someone's life, even if they tried just as hard as the person who succeeded. This is why most of us find it pretty hard to blame A as whether they succeed or not, because we want to encourage that kind of behavior in society. So we praise the behavior when we see it, even though it's the disposition, the intention to do good that actually deserves praise.

Nothing gets people talking like proving the existence of God. Just look at the comments on our last video. And that is what Anne Selma of Canterbury did. He claimed in the 11th centuryific time, Aquinas argued for the existence of God through his understanding of science, and with the help of what he thought was physical evidence. For he figured there must have been a beginning. Otherwise, for him, it would be like watching these blocks fall and being told that nothing ever pushed over the first block. Instead, they had always been falling down forever, backward into eternity. There must have been a time when nothing was in motion, Aquinas thought, and there also must have been a static being that started the motion. And that being, according to Aquinas, is God, the unmoved m back forever. There had to be a first thing that started off the chain of causes and effects. And that thing is God. Argument number three was the argument from contingency. And we should step back and get a little background for this one. In philosophy, we often distinguish between necessary beings and contingent beings. A contingent being is simply put any being that could have not existed. That includes you. Sure, you do exist. But you could not have. If you had never been born, the world would go that there's an infinite regress of contingency and a possibility that nothing might have existed. An infinite regress is impossible, so there must be at least one necessary thing, and that is God. Let that marinate in your brain for a minute while unpacking the next argument. This one is built on the idea that we simply need a measuring stick in order to understand the value of things. Good, bad, big, small, hot, cold, none of these concepts can exist in isolation. If you go on for As philosophers, if you think an argument is flawed, it's your job to try and figure out why. And by and large, philosophers, theists and atheists alike, have been relatively unimpressed by these four, having found many problems in them. For one thing, these arguments don't seem to establish the existence of any particular God, even if the arguments are correct. It doesn't look like Aquinas gets us to the personal loving God that many people pray to. Instead, we're left with unmoved movers and uncaused causers who seem to have little whether it's the movement of objects or causes and effects or contingent beings being created. But it's unclear that this is true, or why it has to be true. If infinite regress can be possible, then Aquinas' first two arguments fall apart. But perhaps the most significant charge made against Aquinas' arguments is that they're self-defeating. That is, they actually prove themselves wrong. For example, if Aquinas' right that everything must have been put into motion by something else, and everything must have a entire project. This is what it means to do philosophy, to engage with arguments about stuff that matters, and whether or not there's a God seems to matter quite a bit, particularly in the lives of theists. Today, we learned about cosmological arguments, and considered four of them. Next time, we'll look at Aquinas' fifth argument, the teleological argument.

This episode of Crash Course Philosophy contains language that may be upsetting for some viewers and may not be appropriate for viewing in certain settings. Consider the following sentence. Jason shot a mouse in his boxer shorts. Simple enough, or is it? Like, my first thought was that Jason was wearing the boxer shorts when he shot the mouse. But maybe the mouse was wearing Jason's boxer shorts or maybe the mouse was wearing his own boxer shorts? Or miscommunication, our mouse and boxer shorts. The reason that sentence is so confusing is because we understand most language by context. But sometimes, like in a lone sentence about a mouse, the context just isn't there. And the result is often rely on what's known as the use-mentioned distinction. This is the difference between talking about a word and talking with the word. Let's look at the difference between using the word philosophy and simply mentioning it. Consider this statement. I have a hard time staying awake in my philosophy class after lunch. Right there, I used the word philosophy. But when can mere words cause harm? To understand this, we need to talk about a linguistic phenomenon known as thick concepts. These are words or ideas that come preloaded not just with descriptive meaning but also with evaluative content. There are attitudes and values that are baked into these words that are hard, if not impossible, to unbake. For instance, murder is a thick concept that contains a description used to describe a homosexual man. But that description is bound up with an inherently hateful attitude, so much so that the target of the word is unable to separate that attitude from the fact about his identity. The word hurts because it tells the target that an essential part of his identity is bad. Being told that you're wearing an ugly shirt or that you have a stupid haircut might us can create what's known as metaphorical identification. Think about the characteristics of your average baby. Helpless, dependent, relying on others to care for them to make decisions for them. Ross argues that when a person is repeatedly referred to with a word like baby, a metaphorical identification gradually takes place whereby she begins to think of herself as having our enemies. They're hurtful, but they're powerful in a somewhat different way because they're almost mainstream. And because we see them as less threatening, no big deal, they could actually be more likely to cause unintentional harm. So consider another word that I really don't want to say, slut. This is another thick concept. It has descriptive content in that it's used to refer to women who have casual sex, but it's the evaluative content that really does the work when this word is use. The philosophy of language can help us bring scary, powerful words out into the open and figure out why they're scary and powerful. And then, with reasoned arguments, we can understand and explain how the language that we use can inflict harm on others. Obviously, deliberately using words to harm is awful. But even if you don't intend hate with the words you use, your audience might not understand that, because speaker meaning and audience meaning don't always match up. Only by thinking seriously about the words we use and what they mean\", 'Philosophy'], [\" Imagine a person who always knows what to say, who can diffuse a tense situation, deliver tough news gracefully, is confident without being arrogant, brave but not reckless, generous but never extravagant. This is the type of person that everybody wants to be around, and to be like, someone who seems to have mastered the art of being a person. This may sound like an impossible feat, but Aristotle believed that while rare, these people do exist, and that the way we flourish is by adhering to that nature. Aristotle described this in terms of what he called proper functioning. Everything has a function, and a thing is good to the extent that it fulfills its function and bad to the extent that it doesn't. This is easy to see in objects created by humans. A function of a knife is to cut, so a dull knife is a bad knife. And a function of a flower is to grow and reproduce, so a flower that doesn't grow is just bad at being a flower be specific because if you're virtuous, you know what to do all the time. You know how to handle yourself and how to get along with others. You have good judgment. You can read a room and you know what's right and when. Aristotle understood virtue as a set of robust character traits that once developed will lead to predictably good behavior. You can think of virtue as the midpoint between two extremes, which Aristotle called vices. Virtue is to Aristotle, courage is the midpoint between the extremes of cowardice and recklessness. Cowardice is a deficiency of courage, while recklessness is an excess of courage, and both are bad. Aristotle said that you definitely can have too much of a good thing. So being courageous doesn't mean rushing headlong into danger. A courageous person will assess the situation. They'll know their own abilities, and they'll take action that is right in the particular situation. It avoids the obvious vice of stinginess, but also doesn't give too much. It's not generous to give drugs to an addict, or to buy a round of drinks for everyone in the bar when you need that money for rent. The right amount of generosity means giving when you have it to those who need it. It can mean having the disposition to give just for the heck of it, but it also means realizing when you can't or shouldn't give. So now you can you at being a good person. But over time, these actions will become an ingrained part of your character. And eventually, it becomes that robust trait that Aristotle was talking about. It'll just manifest every time you need it. That's when you know you have virtue. Fully very best person you could be. This is morality for Aristotle. It's being the best person you can be, honing your strengths while working on your weaknesses. And for Aristotle, the kind of person who lives like this is the kind of person who will do good things.

Philosophy of religion is often confused with theology, which makes sense because they both take God and religion as their subjects. But theology starts with assuming that God exists and then figures out what follows, where theology might try to solve philosophical problems that might arise from religious belief, probably not. So if we can get to the bottom of it, we should. I'll get to God in a minute, but first I want to go over a few things that the philosophy of religion is not. It's not about believing whatever of God's being, or the definition of God. Because the study of being is called ontology, his argument and others like it are called ontological arguments. Now, what do you think God is like? Long, flowing white beard, robe to match. Nice guy, hard to reach on thelyn thought so too. And from there, he believed he could prove God's existence. Because if we define God as the greatest thing that we can conjure up in our minds, the only thing that could possibly be greater than him would be a real version. And since we're already imagining the greatest thing possible, there can't be anything better. Therefore, God has to exist both in imagination and in reality. And Selyn was sure that he had done it, deduct it must exist. Otherwise, it wouldn't be the best island. There would be one better, and that one would have to be real. Basically, Guadalos said, you could make the same kind of argument to prove the existence of whatever you most wanted, but it wouldn't make it real. Anza responded to Guadalos criticism by saying that he'd missed the point, that the argument imagine, but that does not mean that he does exist. Predicates add to the essence of their subjects, Kant explained, but they can't be used to prove their existence. British philosopher John Wisdom came up with a thought exercise that sounds a lot like a debate over an ontological argument for God's existence, while also considering objections to that argument. An important point to note here is that both Guadalupe and Kant agreed with Anselm's conclusion. They also believed in God's existence. They just thought Anselm's argument didn't prove it. So remember, you can think an argument fails even if you accept the conclusion. When this happens, you should look for a better argument in favor of your conclusion.

Sounds pretty boring until I tell you that those vessels were electric blenders. Iveristi named to our reason, and if you recall Plato's idea of the tripartite soul, he thought the rational part of the soul should always be in charge. So art was problematic for him because it encourages us to think with this world's reality. A great example of this is Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Beecher Stowe's story helped change our national mindset about slavery by making white readers see African Americans as human beings with whom they had a lot in common, rather than as a nameless other who should be thought of as property.

Slater, on the other hand, says that he should own the rights because he Aristotle was generally pro-art because he saw it as useful.

He argued that if we haven't been sad in a while or had a good adrenaline rush, we can start to crave those feelings. And when we and energy in shipping? These questions fall under another problem that art poses for us, one that estheticians call the paradox of fiction. Contemporary American philosopher Kendall Walton explains why we can be moved by things that aren't real, by arguing that the emotional responses we have to fictional events aren't real either. Instead, and here, there are two main schools of thought. Some people, called Autonomous, maintain that art and morality are entirely separate. So if something is done in the name of art, it's basically immune from moral scrutiny. It's almost like artists live and work and moralism.

This might sound like a utopia to you, but according to 17th century British philosopher Thomas Hobbes, it would actually be your worst nightmare. Hobbes called this hypothetical time with no rules to govern our behavior the state reason or handed to us on stone tablets by the divine. Morality, he believed, is not primitive or natural. Instead, Hobbes proposed, any time you, is known as contractarianism. Contractarians say that right acts are those that do not violate the free, rational agreements that we've made. And we make these agreements because we think they when you show up for jury duty, and when you accept the punishment for violating the rules, even rules that you disagree with. So, contracts are a pretty brilliant way for making society not just survivable, but possible. They save you from the situation that Hobbes described three years. The problem is, enticed as you are by the offer, you know that your partner is thinking the same thing. And if you each give up the other, then the prosecution will have enough evidence to send you both away for two years. So now you think, no, it's better to stay silent. That way, you'll only get the one year, as long as you can count on your partner to reason the same way. But what if he doesn't? What if you stay quiet and your partner's the rat? Well, that means you're doing slowing down everybody. But you see much less defection among people who know each other, because when you flagrantly violate a contract among people you know, it comes with a heavy social cost. There's a special kind of moral outrage for somebody who freely makes an agreement they didn't have to make, and then violates it, because our whole society is built on the trust that people will keep their word. But there's another important part of this theory, one that we haven't mentioned yet. And that is, in order for is the most permissive of the moral theories we've looked at. Morality is determined by groups of contractors, so whatever they agree to goes. Which means, of course, morality can change. If, as a group, we change our minds, we can simply modify the contract. Which is exactly what happens, explicitly when we change laws, and implicitly with shifting social mores. The contractarianism is still pretty rigid in some ways. If you take on an obligation, you have a duty to keep it.

Or in college when you set your clock ten minutes ahead to fool yourself to get the class on time. We all engage in useful fictions. Things that we choose to believe because they just make life easier. And when we do this, we are being pragmatists. Pragmatism is based on the theory that finding true beliefs in history may not be all that surprising. But what is weird is that Pascal's argument for God's existence had very little to do with whether God was actually real. Instead, it had everything to do with whether belief in his existence was practical. This reasoning became known as Pascal's Wager, and it's really a gambler'sstar lifestyle, or I don't know coveting stuff. For this logic, you'd lose out if you abstained from all of that in the name of something that ended up not being real. But Pascal, like William James, disagreed with this line of reasoning because he saw great personal benefit in being a believer. He thought theists have better lives not because God is blessing them as some kind of reward, but because belief simply has inherent benefits, like the security of feeling that the world is ordered and meaningful. That one was never made. India is painted as a pretty agnostic character. He hunts religious relics for a living, but the powers that those relics are said to possess are just hocus pocus to him. So at the end of the last crusade, spoilers, Indiana just defined the Holy Grail in an ancient temple after getting through a bunch of booby traps. And each trap is kind of a test of faith. He has to know where to kneel, how to spell the name of God, and he belief is just practically useful. But Soren Kierkegaard, the 19th century Danish philosopher, went even further. He adopted the the existence of a China teapot, orbiting the sun somewhere between Earth and Mars. Let's say that back on Earth there were a bunch of teapotists, people who argued that since we can't disprove the teapot's existence, they were justified in believing in it. Not only that, they constructed great buildings, erected statues, composed songs, held weekly services, and appealed to the teapot for help in their daily lives. But everyone else thought the teapotists were ridiculous, because there was no evidence to support have faith in the things I choose to have faith in. And in that case, no one can tell anyone else that their belief is wrong or dangerous or unjustified, because you can't justify faith.

What we saw in the last video is that Patty had a comparative advantage in plates relative to Charlie because her opportunity cost of producing one plate was lower than Charlie's opportunity cost of producing a plate. Hers was one third of a cup, his was three cups. So that's why it made sense for her to specialize in plates. Charlie on then it is true. Patty would have an absolute advantage in plates. And if given the same number of inputs, Charlie is able to produce more cups than Patty, then he would have an absolute advantage in cups. But it is not because of that absolute advantage that he is specializing it. In fact, we don't even know what their inputs were. It might be that he doesn't have an absolute advantage. Maybe Charlie, maybe Charlie needs 100 people to produce his let's still put Patty. Let's assume Patty hasn't changed. So this is her PPF. So that is Patty's PPF, just like that. But let's say that Charlie has improved dramatically. And so Charlie's PPF looks like this. So this is Charlie's PPF. So what is his opportunity cost? So say he's sitting here, what is his opportunity cost of producing? So he's producing 40 cups, what would be his opportunity cost of producing 40 plates? Well, to produce those 40 plates, he would have to give up one third of a cup to make a plate. So Patty still has a comparative advantage in plates. And if we look at the comparative advantage or if we look at the opportunity costs in cups, the opportunity costs for Charlie to make one cup is one plate. So it actually, it's actually a little bit, it's actually a little bit worse than it was before, but that's, as we'll see, that it ends up being a good thing. He's is going to specialize, she is going to specialize in plates and she's going to sit right there and produce, let me introduce a different color, I don't want to use his color, and she's going to sit right over there and produce 30 plates a day. So how could they trade for mutual benefit? Well, any trade that is better than they're, assuming that they don't want to have only plates or they don't only want to have cups, any trade that is cheaper than see if Charlie would be willing to trade two plates for one cup. So he has all of these cups. How many cups does he have to give away for a plate? Well, he has to give away one cup for a plate. Now he would have to give away one cup for two plates. Or he would have to give up half a cup for a plate. Either way, this is better than his opportunity cost of trying to get that incremental plate. So he would be end up at this scenario right over here, which was beyond. It was unattainable when he was working by himself when he didn't specialize and get these gains from trade. So this is a good scenario for him. He's able to get outcomes that he otherwise would not have been able to get.

I'm not gonna put it all the way at the end. I'm gonna put air, air to breathe on earth. Now right now it's a non-rival good. When I take a deep breath, it doesn't make it hard for you to take another breath and vice versa. There's other things like, well, roads are rival goods, especially if we're talking about rush hour. So let me put this right over here. So let's call this the roads during rush hour. Roads during rush hour. The more people that are on the roads that is gonna make it harder for other people to use it simultaneously. We'll get all this traffic. People won't even be able to get on the highway,\", 'Economics'], [\" In this video, we're going to talk about the law of demand, which is one of the core ideas of microeconomics. And lucky for us, it's a fairly intuitive idea. It just tells us that if we raise the price of a product, that will lower the quantity demanded for the product. Quantity demanded will go down, and you can imagine the other side of that.. Hopefully by the end of this video, the difference between demand and quantity demanded will become a little bit clearer and definitely over the next few videos because in this video we're gonna focus on how the quantity demanded changes relative to price. In future videos, we'll talk about how the entire relationship, how demand changes based on different factors. But to make things concrete, let's say I'm about to release demanded. So scenario, let's call this scenario A, I could price my book at $2. I could price my book at $2 and I'll get a vice versa, this is what we call demand schedule. Now we can also, based on this demand schedule, draw a demand curve. And really we're just going to plot these points and draw the curve that connects them because we don't have to just, these aren't the only scenarios, anything in between is possible. We could charge $2.01 for the book. We could charge $4.50 for the book. And so quantity demanded goes all the way up to 60,000. So that's a C. This 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. So that's 10. This is in 10, 20, 30, 40, sorry, not 45, 40, 50, and 60. And this is in thousands. This is in thousands. And then the price goes up to $10, from $2 to $10. So let's $10.23,000 units. So it might be something like that. That is scenario E. And so we could actually have prices anywhere in between that and maybe we could even go further. So this right over here, so if I were to draw the demand curve, it could look something like this. The demand curve would look something. I'm trying to do my best to draw it as a straight continuous line. It could look something like that and it could keep going\", 'Economics'], [\" We've talked a lot about demand, so now let's talk about supply, and we'll use grapes as this example. We'll pretend to be grape farmers of some sort. So I will start by introducing you, and maybe I'll do in purple in honor of the grapes, to the law of supply, which like the law of demand makes a lot of intuitive sense. If we hold all else equal, in the next few videos, we'll talk about what happens when we change some of those supply increasing, we're talking about the entire relationship shifting, or either up or down. So let's just make sure that this makes intuitive sense for us, and I think it probably does. Let's think about ourselves as grape farmers, and I'll make a little supply schedule right over here. Supply, so grape, grape supply schedule, which is really just a table showing the relationship between all else equal if the price per pound of grapes is 50 cents, if it's 50 cents per pound, actually let me just do, let me just do, let me just do round numbers, but you get the idea. If the price per pound is $1, let's just say for us we consider that to be a relatively low price. And so we'll only kind if the price were $3 $3 per pound now we do want to produce more We'll we'll maybe we're even willing to work a little harder or or plant things closer to each other or maybe I or or maybe I'll get even more land Involved that I would have otherwise used for other crops and so then I get and then I the horizontal axis quantity produce or thousand quantity produced I'll say in the next year. We're assuming all of this is for the next year. So next year next year and it's in thousands of pounds. So I'll put it in thousands of pounds and so let's see we go all the way from have to view it that way. So let's, so $1,000, 1,000 pounds, $2,000, 2,000 pounds, $2,000, 2,000 pounds, $3, not this isn't $3, this is $3, $3, 2,500 pounds. So right about there, that looks, that's about 2,500, but I want to do it in that blue color so we don't get confused. So $3, 2,500 pounds, that's about right. So this is scenario.\", 'Economics'], [\" An idea that will keep coming up as you study economics is the idea of the four factors of production, which are usually listed as land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. And the idea of labor. To produce many or most things, someone has to work on it. So someone had of that as capital. So all of this stuff is capital. The hangers that they're putting the coats on after they produce it, that is capital. In this farm example, the capital would be the buildings. These were constructed so that they could produce the food a reasonable way. And obviously, you want to produce as much as possible, given the other factors that you are putting into the production. A related idea, and it sometimes is used interchangeably in an economics course, is technology. So sometimes you'll see the four factors of production is land, labor, capital, consumption goods. Consumption goods. Consumption goods are goods that are just used. It might make people happy, they might find pleasure in it, but it's not being used to produce other things. And because our production resources are scarce, there's a trade-off when a society or a factory or whoever decides how much capital to produce versus how much\", 'Economics'], [\" In the last video we introduced ourselves to the law of supply and it was a fairly common sense idea that if we hold all else equal that if the price of something goes up there's more incentive for more producers to produce it or a given producer to produce more of it and we saw that as the price goes up we moved along the supply curve and the quantity produced went up. Now what I want to talk about in this video is produce less. Or maybe I would produce other things. So the whole supply curve would shift to the left. And also even the minimum price I would need to supply any of it would also go up when you shift the curve to the left, because now all of a sudden it costs me more to produce even that first unit. And likewise, if the price of a related good, in particular blueberries, what would happen if the price of blueberries went up? Well, if the price of blueberries went up, then I would say, wow, maybe I can do better with blueberries, and I would allocate more of my land to blueberries than to grapes. And so once again, if the price of related goods, well, it depends which related goods. So if the number of suppliers goes up, and now you wouldn't imagine, this is a curve maybe for the aggregate supply. So if the number of suppliers go up, then the aggregate supply would go up at any given price point. If the number of suppliers were to go down, then the aggregate supply would go down at any given price point. So this one hopefully is somewhat obvious. Then we could think about things like technology. And let's go away from the grapes because grapes are their perishable goods. They go bad. It's not like you can save goods to use them later. But if let's say you are an oil producer, an oil is something that you can store and you can use it later. If you expected oil prices to be neutral today, and then tomorrow, all of a sudden you are sure that oil prices are going to go up in the\", 'Economics'], [\" So let's say we're in a very simplified world where we have two countries, country A and country B, and they're each capable of producing apples or bananas or some combination of them. And what this chart tells us, if country A put all of their energy behind apples in a day, they could produce three apples. And if they put all of their energy behind bananas in a day, they could produce six bananas. Similarly, country B, if they put all of the energy behind apples in a day, they could is two bananas, two bananas, I'll just write bananas per apple. And their opportunity cost for bananas is just going to be the, so no comparative advantage in either. Advantage, advantage in either. If they put all of the energy behind bananas, they could produce, let's just say this is two, four, six. So that's six, this is four, this is two, this is three right over here. Let me put markers in between to make this clear. So out of colors, country B right over here, they can either produce four bananas or two apples or things in between. But notice, it has the exact same slope. The slope is the opportunity cost. And if we switch these axes right over here, then the slope would be the opportunity cost for bananas in terms of apples. But the big takeaway here, if you see the production possibilities of two countries,\", 'Economics'], [\" Let's say that we have some country, let's call it utensilandia, that can only produce one of two goods or some combination of them. So it can produce forks and it can produce or it could produce spoons. And so this axis is a quantity of forks, this axis is a quantity of spoons. And let's say that if it put all of its energy into forks, well it would produce that many forks and no spoons. But then the production possibilities curve. So this point right over here, this combination of spoons, which would be that many spoons and that many forks, this combination over here, this would be efficient. That point X would be an efficient production for utensilondia. So with this point right over here, let's actually going to be an unattainable point for Utah, but let's say you really want to reach it. How can that happen? Well, you can actually have investment or you could have more low land or more labor. So let's think about that scenario. So let me draw the two axes. So that's my fork axis. That's the quantity of forks that Utah and we are showing a situation right over here. This is still a production possibilities curve, but we're showing what happens when you have growth. And once again, what are the drivers of growth? Well, this could be the amount of land that you have goes up. The amount's able to destroy some of the factories and other forms of capital. Maybe people flee utenslandia. So there is less labor. And maybe for whatever reason they can support less technology. Or they forget how to use some of their technology because the war is so long and protracted. Well in that situation, your PPC you would see contraction.\", 'Economics'], [\" Let's say we've been hanging out in Scenario E for a bunch of days. On average we've been catching one rabbit, but gathering 280 berries. We were in a berry mood. So this is Scenario E right over here. But now all of a sudden we're in the mood for more protein. So let me write down. We are in Scenario E. And we're in the mood for more protein. And so we want to think about what are the trade-offs if we try to catch more rabbits. So what I want to do, I have a cost, so I have to give up on average 40, 40 berries. And the technical term for what I've just described is the opportunity cost there? But let's make sure we understand opportunity cost. So that's when we're sitting in scenario E, the opportunity cost of one more rabbit. But what's the opportunity cost sitting in, let's say we're tired of eating meat, we're sitting in scenario E and we want to become vegetarians altogether. So I want to write this as a marginal cost of one more berry, then I could just say, well, if 20 berries is one rabbit, you could say, you could essentially divide both sides by 20. So one more berry, one more, one more berry, and I'll assume for those of you who want to get technical that it's somewhat linear right over here, one more berry, if we divide both sides by 20, is one more berry is one 20th, one 20th,\", 'Economics'], [\" As we begin our journey into the world of economics, I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all times, the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. And he really is kind of the first real economist in the way that we view it now. And this is from his The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, coincidentally, the same year as the American Declaration of Independence. And it promotes that of the society more effectively than when he really intends to promote it. So this is a pretty strong statement. It's really at the core of capitalism. And that's why I point out that it was published the same year as the American Declaration of Independence because obviously America, the founding fathers, they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution. It really talks about what it means to be a for everyone. And now economics is frequently, and when he makes a statement, he's actually making a mix of a macroeconomic and a macroeconomic statement. Micro is that people, individual actors are acting in their or labor. These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is, well, how do people decide where to put those scarce resources people make decisions. So philosophy philosophy of of people of decision-making in the case of in the case of microeconomics decision- on some assumptions that either might be wrong or might be oversimplifications or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about. So it's very, very, very important to take it all with the grain of salt to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumptions. And macroeconom. I'll leave you with two quotes. And these quotes are a little bit funny, but they really, I think, are helpful things to keep in mind as you start to especially go deep into the mathematical side of economics. So this right over here is a quote by Alfred Knopf, who was a publisher in the 1900s, an economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible. And I'm assuming when he's\", 'Economics'], [\" So let's say we are in the Apple market. What I want to do in this video is think about both demand and supply for the apples at different prices. So let's draw ourselves a little graph here. And we already know this right over here. The vertical axis is the price axis. And this is, we're going to say it's price per pound. And the horizontal axis, this is the quantity. The quantity of apples. Let's put some tick marks here.'m being very careful to say the quantity demanded is 500 apples. I'm not saying the demand is 500 apples. The demand is the entire relationship. The actual specific quantity, we call that the quantity demanded. So the price of $5, the quantity demanded would be about 500. Maybe at a price of $1, the quantity demanded would be maybe 4,000 that is fairly isolated and all of that. Now let's think about what happens in different scenarios. What happens if the suppliers of the apples going into that week for their own planning purposes, they just think for whatever reason that they're only going to be able to sell the apples at a shortage of 3,000 apples at that price point. At a dollar a lot more people are going to want to bit, so maybe the price goes to $2. And the quantity goes to, I don't know, this looks like about 1900, 1900 pounds. Now all of a sudden, you have less of a shortage. And I think you see that I'm getting to an interesting point over here, but I won't go there just yet. I won't go there just yet. Now let's think about another situation. Let's think about after this happens, price and quantity demanded? The quantity demanded is now much lower. The price is high now. Because consumers might want to go buy other things or they can't afford an apple or whatever it might be. And so now the quantity demanded, quantity is also going to start going down. They'll produce fewer and fewer apples. And so we'll move here. We'll move here along the supply curve. And as you decrease the price, what's going to happen to the demand curve? Well, the demand is going to go up. So over here, the price was too high. So it. Equilibrium price is $2.15 a pound. And it's the price at which the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. And so this quantity where the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded, that's the equilibrium quantity. Equilibrium.\", 'Economics'], [\" What we're going to do in this video is think about all of the different ways that a supply curve or a demand curve can shift. And that's why we actually have eight versions of the exact same diagram. Each of them is showing where we are right now, let's say in a given region, in the ice cream markets. Important to title your graphs, especially if you were taking some type of a standardized exam like an AP exam enters into the market. So here we're going to, this first one, we're gonna think about a situation where the supply goes up. So one way to think about it is, for a given price, people are willing to supply less. That. So for example, that price up. Well, if demand goes down, you can imagine the opposite is going to happen. So here, if we have demand goes down, let's say a big study comes out that ice cream is even unhealthier than we originally thought. Well then at a given price, people are going to want, they're going to demand less ice cream. And so our demand curve would shift to the left and down.\", 'Economics'], [\" In other videos, we have already looked at production possibility curves and output tables in order to calculate opportunity costs of producing a certain product in a certain country. And then we use that to think about comparative advantage. We're going to do something very similar in this video, but instead of starting with output, we're going to start with input. So right over here, we'll just assume that there are eight working hours, eight working hours per day in either country. And so from this, can we construct an output table? Let me put this right over here. Output, output the traditional way, and then we can think about in which country do we have a comparative advantage. So let's see, toy cars in country A. If it takes two hours to produce one toy car in country A, and if you're working, if the average or if the worker is working eight hours per day, and you're gonna be able to make 8-3rd belts per worker per day. This is the same thing as 2-3rd belts per worker per day. So as you can see, we can easily translate between the input world and the output world, and then could also use that to produce eight belts. So if I were to divide both sides by four, the energy to create one car is equal to the energy to create two belts. Soand-one-third of a belt. And then if I start right over here, and I multiply both sides by three-eighths, actually let me do that over here, so I have three-eighths times two-c is equal to eight-thirds b times three-eighths. These cancel out. And over here, I'm gonna have six-eighths c B has the comparative advantage in toy cars. It has less of an opportunity cost in toy cars, even though country A has the absolute advantage. Its workers are more efficient at producing toy cars. A worker can produce four cars in country A versus two in country B. But despite that, because of the opportunity cost, it would actually make sense for country B to focus on cars.\", 'Economics'], [\" We've talked a little bit about the law of demand, which tells us all else equal. If we raise the price of a product, then the quantity demanded for that product will go down. Common sense. If we lower the price and the quantity demanded will go up, and we'll see so a few special cases for this. But what I want to do in this video is focus on these other things that we've been holding equal. The things that allow us to make this statement, that allow us to move along this curve. is price, price goes up. The price of other ebooks go up. So what will that do to our price-quantity-demanded relationship? If other ebooks prices go up, now all of a sudden my e-book, regardless of what price point we're at, this thing is constant. If this thing changes, this is going to move the curve. If other e-books prices go up, it'll probably shift our curve to the right. If other e-books prices go down, that will shift our entire curve to the left. So this is actually changing our demand. It's changing our whole relationship. So it's shifting demand to the right. So let me write that. So this is going price goes up. Now the Kindle is not a substitute. People won't either buy my ebook or buy a Kindle. Kindle is a compliment. You actually need a Kindle or an iPad or something like it in order to consume my ebook. So this right over here is a compliment. It is a compliment.

And arguably, we wouldn't even need a field of economics if there wasn't the notion of scarcity in the world. So what does scarcity mean? Well, think about it. What does it mean in everyday life? It means that there's not enough of something to go around. If we're talking about scarce goods, scarce services, scarce resources, we're talking about things where if there good idea of what resources are scarce and which ones aren't and why. So this is a picture of caviar, which is essentially fish eggs. And it's not easy to get. The fish eggs are deep in the water, someone has to get to them and then they have to package it in some way and they have to get it to your plate. And so do labor, would you consider that a scarce resource or a free resource? What would be a free resource if people were willing to just do as much work for other people, actually willing to do an infinite amount of work for other people, which isn't even humanly possible.. Someone has to set up the pipes. Maybe it has to be cleaned in some way. Well, then it might become a little bit more of a scarce resource.

So let's say we're going to talk about two products, two types of dinnerware. We'll have cups on this axis and we will have plates on this axis. And let's say we have a producer, Charlie, and if you were to focus all of his time on cups, he could produce, What is his opportunity cost of producing 10 plates? Well to produce 10 plates. He's gonna have to give up those 30 cups so his opportunity cost of producing 10 plates 10 plates is equal to 30 cups 30 cups or if you want the opportunity cost for one plate You just divide both sides by 10 and. So her opportunity cost to produce 30 plates is equal to 10 cups, or if you divide both sides by 30, the opportunity cost of her producing one plate, one plate in terms of cups is 10 divided by 30 is one third, one third of a cup. and we'll talk about that more. She has a comparative advantage because her opportunity cost is lower. Her opportunity cost for producing a plate is lower than it is for Charlie. Now let's think about what the other way around. Who has a comparative advantage in cups? Well, if we divide both sides of this right over here by three, we can see that if, or let's swap both sides. So the opportunity cost for producing an extra cup is a third of a plate and patties is three plates. So Charlie has the lower opportunity cost for producing a cup. So it's only one third plate relative to three plates. So this is where Charlie has the comparative, comparative ed, comparative advantage.enta. She's going to produce 30 plates every day. Now imagine, I'm going to make an assumption here, but imagine that they both do that, but they don't only want to have what they're producing. They want to have some combination of them, so they decide to trade. And I'm going to just fix the price here. We're going to talk more about markets in the future, but I assume that they agree to give up one plate. So this is a good deal. This is lower than our opportunity cost so she'll want to transact. And so they can do each of them. So for example, Charlie can keep trading cups for plates and he could end up anywhere on this line right over there. And Patty could actually do the same thing. She could trade cups for plates and end up someplace over there. But obviously where they end up is dependent on how much the other one is willing to trade. But let's say they both want to get to that 15-15 scenario. So they can both\", 'Economics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is think about how supply and or demand might change based on changes in some factors in the market. And then think about what that might do to the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity. So let's say at some period this is what the supply curve looks like and this is what the demand curve looks like. And then all changed at all, so this is our new equilibrium price. So our new equilibrium price is lower, so the price went down. And you don't have to, you could have probably reasoned through that before taking an equilibrium price. This is our new equilibrium price. The price clearly went up. So the price went up. And actually over here, let's think about the quantity two in this first situation. This is our old equilibrium quantity. This is our new equilibrium cider. Now all of a sudden, pear cider comes out. It'll make demand for apple cider go down. So this is apple cider demand will go down. Now if apple cider demand goes down, the apple cider producers are going to demand fewer apples. So this're both shifting to the left. Now, what is likely to happen here? So the demand went down and the supply went down. They both shifted to the left. Well, here the way I drew it, this was our old equilibrium price. This is our new equilibrium price. It actually looks the way that I drew it right over here, that it did not change. The curve shapes and all of that. The main thing is to reason through it or to actually see what the actual results are. But in this situation, all of a sudden, that the price went up. But the quantity definitely still went down. So in this case, the one thing that you're always going to be sure of is that the quantity will go down. But the price went up because this effect, the supply went down much more than the demand did. And so the price went up. Now I could a given price point, they are less profitable, less willing to produce apples. So, at a given price point, so we're talking about the suppliers, at a given price point, they will supply a lower quantity. They will supply a lower quantity. So, this is going to lower supply. This is going to lower supply, and when you lower supply, what's going to happen? Well, your equilibrium quantity,\", 'Economics'], [\" In this video, we're going to talk about different ways of structuring an economy, in particular who owns what and how does an economy decide what to produce and who gets the output of that production. So on one side, you have what's known as a command economy. And good examples of command economies are the communist states, especially during the 20th century, the USSR, the Soviet this is my best drawing of a field really fast. And so it needs to say, hey, you need to produce, I don't know, 10 million apples. I don't even know if that's a reasonable amount of apples to produce, but you need to produce 10 million apples. And so the farmers who essentially work for the government, because the government would own that farm, they would produce those apples. And also in a command economy, there's like, well, who gets these cars and who gets these apples gets those things. In a market economy, it's all based on the factory right over here, independent of the government for the most part unless you're in certain fact fields that might have strong influence from the government, let's say you're a military contractor, but if you're not in one of those fields, if you're fairly independent of the government, what they would say is, well, what does the market need? They might say, hey, look, the peaches are in fashion this year. And similarly, who gets these is not dictated by the government, it's determined by the market. And so let's say this is me, let's say this is you, let's say this is someone else. If I might not be interested in getting a truck, but I really need to get a new car for my family so I can drive them around and take vacations and things. And so, might say, well, what are the positives and negatives that people generally associate with command economies or market economies? Well, the motivation that's often given for a command economy is some notion of fairness or some notion of equality. That when you have a market economy as a byproduct of this mechanism where different people are competing, some people are innovating more access to resources than people who didn't. In a market economy, yes, there will be some inequality, but the best thing going for it, and the reason why most economies in people. Now the reality is is most economies as I mentioned they're close to a market economy but they aren't a perfect market economy. You still have the government very involved in certain\", 'Economics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is think about how the opportunity cost can change as we move from scenario to scenario. This is going to be particular to this example, but it's a phenomenon that you will see in many economic scenarios. So let's say we're starting off in scenario F. We are vegetarians. We are only getting berries. We are not spending any time going after rabbits. But now we're starting to, I guess, crave protein. And we say,. What am I going to give up? Well, I'm going to give up 60 berries. If I find, if I'm able to get three rabbits every day on average, then I'm only going to get 180 berries now instead of 240. And let's just keep going. So if I want yet another rabbit every day, then I'm going to have to give up, then I'm going to have to give up 80 berries. 80 berries. And then finally, just to. But the question, an interesting question is, OK, Sal, you set up the numbers like this earlier two videos ago. But why would this make sense? Why is this idea of increasing opportunity costs showing up in a lot of different economic, and you could call this an economic model? We've simplified our economic reality, the choices that we have to make down to two variables, the number of rabbits we have to And so that was very easy to get. It didn't take much time on a given day to get those really easy rabbits who like to hang out with you. You're not giving up a lot in terms of berries. You're not giving up a lot in terms of berries. One, it didn't take you much time to get those literally those slow and maybe less quick witted rabbits. And you're giving up in that same amount of time the very hard to get berries. So you're only going to give of why increasing opportunity cost does show up and when you graphically show it in terms of a production possibilities frontier it shows up in this bow shaped curve and you can see it because as we go from this point to this point you see that as we increase one the slope the negative slope is increasing. So or another way to think about scenario F the slope is roughly like this and I encourage you to review the algebra\", 'Economics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is think about the demand curve for two different products.

This is actually a picture of a 1985 UGO, but we're just assuming it's the cheapest car in the market. So let's just think about their hypothetical demand curves right now. So once again in the And I'm not going to even specify what the price is, but this is a general idea. If the price is higher, fewer people are going to want to buy it. If the price is lower, more people are going to want to buy it. So it's demand curve. We'll also have this shape from the top left to the because people would have less money to buy something like a laptop. And this is the case for most goods. And we call things like this, when income goes up, demand goes up, the whole curve shifts to the right, income goes down, demand goes down, whole curve shifts to the left. We call this a normal good. So this right. It actually will decrease. So the whole curve could shift to the left. The whole curve could shift to the left. So income did a very strange thing for this good. Because in-crumb increasing made people say, hey, you know what, I could trade out of this good. I could get a good that I'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here. Demand went down. And goods like this we call inferior goods.\", 'Economics'], [\" So we've been going through all of the other things that we were assuming are held constant in order to be moving along one demand curve. And now let's list a few other. And before I do any more of them, let's talk about the ones we already talked about. So one we said that one of the things we held constant, let me write this down. So held constant, held constant. One of the things that we goes up, then it increases demand. Demand goes up. And remember, when we're talking about income, when demand goes up, we're talking about the whole curve shifting to the right. At any given price point, we're probably going to have a larger quantity demanded. So the whole curve, this whole demand change the curve. So, for example, if all of a sudden, I'm, you know, the author of the book is on some very popular show, talk show that tells everyone that this is the best book that would ever written, then preferences would go up and that would increase the total demand. At any given price point, more people would\", 'Economics'], [\" When you think about what the field of economics is about, it is quite daunting. An economy is made up of billions or even billions of actors organized in incredibly complex ways. Right then, this is complex, real world. And each of the actors, human beings or organizations, these are incredibly complex. A human brain, your chemistry class, that relates the pressure to the volume, to the number of particles you have to the actual temperature. And so this right over here, where you're taking something that's hairy and complex and making simplifying assumptions to help you understand it, this thing right over here is a model. And this is in other fields as well. Sometimes it's not an than a human being and at least to our modern ethics, we're willing to do certain things to mice that we aren't willing to do to human beings. And so that's why in a biological context, you will hear people talk about things like a mouse model where they will test a drug on a mouse or try to understand how something happens in a mouse and frontier, where it assumes that you're only trading off between two things and everything else is equal. This notion of ceteris paribus, which means all things equal. In a real world, you're not gonna be economics by revisiting some simplifying assumptions and coming up with new models. The other difficulty about economics is it's hard to test it in as absolute a way, definitely as something like chemistry or physics. But even in biology, where you're dealing with similarly complex systems, a human body and an economy, these are both extremely complex systems.

And in particular, in this video, we're going to get a little bit deeper to make sure we understand the difference between a change in supply, and I'm just using the Greek letter delta here for shorthand for change in supply, versus a change in quantity, quantity supplied. And just as a bit of a review, we for example, at some price, so let's say we have this price P1 right over here, associated with that price, we would have some quantity supplied. We have some quantity supplied, let's call it quantity supplied one. And then let's say that price cap is below the current price. So let's say the current price is at P2, and that the price cap, the price cap is at P3. So the government says, no one is allowed to charge more than P3 for gasoline. What would that result in? Would that result in a change in supply or a change in the quantity supplied? Well, this is a that would increase the cost of producing gasoline, which is refined from oil, across the board, regardless of what price we're at. So this would be a general shift. This would be a change in supply. And the entire supply curve, to think about which way it would shift, if the property tax goes down, the cost of running a gas station goes down. And this is for everyone in the market, not just one player in the market. And so they might, for a given price, be able to supply more of a\", 'Economics'], [\" Let's imagine a very simple world as we tend to do in economics that has two countries that are each capable of producing either pants or shirts or some combination. And so what we have here are the production possibility curves for each of those countries and this is in per worker per day. So for example in country A, per worker per day, they could if they put all of their energy into pants, they could produce 20. If they put all of their energy into shirts, they could produce 10 or there could be some combination that would sit on this line. Now from either these production possibility curves or from this output table, because we have a constant opportunity cost, these production possibility curves are straight lines with a fixed slope, we can calculate the opportunity cost. So let's do that next. So this is country A, and then this is country B, and let me calculate the opportunity cost of pants, and let's calculate the opportunity cost for shirts, we could take the reciprocal of this number. We could say it's going to be two over one pants. Or we could start with this equation right over here. And instead of solving for P, we could solve for S. How much energy in terms of pants does it take for the same energy for one shirt would be 30, 45ths of a pair of pants, which is the same thing as two thirds of a pair of pants. And so I could write that as two thirds of a pair of pants, or if I want, so here we compare this to this, and likewise, if we try to look at shirts right over here, if we look at their opportunity costs, country B is only giving up 2 thirds of a pair of pants, while country A would be giving up two pairs of pants, so country B has the lower opportunity cost, or the comparative advantage in shirts, because we're really thinking of price in terms of another good, at price greater than their opportunity cost, greater than one half of a shirt. And you could think of this willing to trade or sell, I'll put that in quotes, they're really trading in our everyday language 1Shirt. And now let's appreciate the gains from trade that they would both have here. So let's imagine this world where country A is producing 20P per worker per day.

So let's think about the different scenarios here and the trade-offs that they involve. And just for simplicity, we're going to assume that when you're talking about hunting, the only animal around you to hunt for are these little rabbits. And when we talk about gathering, the only thing that you can gather are some type of berries that'll keep our conversation a little bit simpler. So let's think about all of a sudden you're able to get 100 berries. And when we do these different scenarios, we're assuming that everything else is equal. You're not changing the amount of time you have either hunting or gathering. You're not changing the amount of sleep. You're not changing your techniques for hunting rabbits or hunting berries, or you're more scenarios, assuming ceteris parabas. So let me do scenario C. You could, on average, have enough time to get three rabbits. But if you get three rabbits, then all of a sudden, you will only be able to get, or you will be able to get, or if you're only getting three rabbits, you're now going to get 180 berries. And let's do a couple more. I'm going to do two plot these and on one axis I'll have the number of rabbits, on the other axis I'll have the number of berries. So let me do it right over here. So this axis, I will call this my rabbit axis, rabbits, and we'll start that'll be zero. And then this will be one, two, three, four, and then that will be. Three rabbits 180. Let's see, this would be 150. 180 will be like right over there. So three, if you have time for three rabbits, you have time for about 180 berries on average. So this is scenario C. And then scenario D, we have in white. If you have time for two I guess you could on average get four and a half rabbits on average on average get three and a half rabbits And then you'd have a different number of berries. So these are all points on the different Combinations between the trade-offs of rabbits and berries. Let me connect all of these Let me connect them in a color that I haven't used yet. So let me connect them and what you see It should just be one curve. So I'll do is a dotted line. that we've talked about so far, these are just scenarios on this curve. And that curve we call, once again, fancy term curve or below the curve or to the left of the curve, all of these points right over here are possible. All of these points right over here are these points, for example. It is very easy for me to get one rabbit and 200 berries. So that right over there is possible. Now, is that optimal?\", 'Economics'], [\" So we have three different possible production possibilities curves for rabbits and berries here, which we've already talked about in other videos. But the reason why I'm showing you three different curves is because these three different curves clearly have different shapes. And we want to think about why you would have what and under what scenarios would you have these different shapes. Here are production possibilities curve or PPC. It looks like a straight line. Here it looks like because I'm probably not, the berries I'm giving up are probably the ones that are hardest to pick. And so let's say that first rabbit, the opportunity cost, I pick 20 less berries. So notice, when I increase the rabbits by one, my berries go down by 20. So my opportunity cost is 20 berries for that first rabbit. But let's say that second rabbit is a little out of the way, which of these would describe a decreasing opportunity cost? Maybe you can imagine a scenario where every incremental rabbit I catch, I get better and better at catching rabbits. Well, you might guess that if this one is increasing and I'm bowed out, then being bowed in would be, my opportunity cost is 60 berries. I'm getting really good at catching rabbits. So clearly you see here that for each incremental rabbit I get, my opportunity cost is decreasing. All the way to that fifth rabbit, maybe my opportunity cost is 20, is 20 berries. To catch that next extra rabbit, I'm giving up those 20 berries. So very clearly you see a decreasing opportunity cost.

But what we started talking about is what happens when you change some of those things that we've been holding equal, how does that change demand? forward. So now, now expect the future price to go up. What's going to happen? If you expect the future price to go up and the good or the product in question is something that you can store, remember, and I'm probably tired of me saying this, I'm not talking about a particular quantity. I'm talking about the entire curve shifting to the right because people expect future prices to go up. So the current demand went up. The current demand curve shifted to the right.

And below, right over here, we have a chart that shows the production possibility curves for two different countries. And as we see in many economic models, this is an oversimplified model, those look like socks, but you get the idea. Once again, per worker per day. And so let me draw a little chart here so we can do that. And so what I'd like you to do is pause this video and see if you can fill in this chart. What is the maximum basketballs per worker per day in country A and then in country B and then could produce four pairs of shoes. And so it's as simple as that. This output table is just showing the extremes from the production possibility curves for these countries. Now, and I'll just say B for short, cost six, six, S. S is shoes for short shoes, or divide both by four. You could have a basketball, one basketball, costs one pair of shoes. So a basketball here in country B costs one pair of shoes. So one pair of shoes. S once again is a pair of shoes. And you could have also gotten to this equation right over here. If we are in country A, we would say six shoes, if we put all our energy in shoes, we could produce six of them, or six pairs of shoes, I should say. And if we put all of our energy into basketballs, we could produce eight basketballs. But if you divide by six, you get per pair of shoes. And so each pair of shoes, the energy to produce one pair of shoes is equivalent to the energy of making a basketball, so the opportunity cost of making a pair of shoes is equal to one basketball. So now we're ready to draw the connection. Given the opportunity costs that we have calculated, what country has the comparative advantage in basketballs? Pause this video and try to figure it out. So now let's look at the opportunity cost of producing a basketball in either country. In country A, it's each basketball costs\", 'Economics'], [\" What we're going to do in this video is a deep dive into the difference between demand and quantity demanded. In particular, we're going to focus on change in demand versus change in quantity demanded. And so just as context, I have price versus quantity here for brand X of cars in a certain market. And you see the demand curve for brand X of cars. And we see that it follows the classic law of demand. in a change in demand versus a change in quantity demanded. So in this first scenario, we say car dealerships slash prices by 10%. Would that result in a change in demand, which would involve shifting our demand curve, or would it involve a shift along the curve, a change in quantity demanded? Pause then when they slash their prices, the prices go down. And so we end up with this point on our demand curve. And so this would be quantity call this D1 here, now this would be D2. So here we would say change in demand, and in this case our change in demand, it would shift. It would go down. You could view it as shifting to the left, so it's similar to bullet point two. Now let's see, here we say the state lowers vehicle registration fees. Pause this video and think about that.

Let's see if we can do the same thing now with a variable electric field and actually then we can figure out the electric potential of one position relative to another. So let's say we have a point charge. It's always radially outward from the charge. This is a bit review for you. And these are just field, this is a vector field that I'm drawing where I'm just randomly picking points and showing the vector of the field at that point that it's pointed outward Q2. I'm not a big Q, I'll do a small one. All right up here since I already messed up down there. Q2 and let's say this is a positive charge, so it is going to be repelled from this, from Q1. And let's calculus and the calculus playlist. But how much work does it require to move this particle a very, very small distance? Let's just assume over this very, very, very small distance that the electric field is roughly constant. And so we can say that the very, very small amount, just to get it moving, and then our force would completely offset the force of the field and the particle would neither accelerate nor decelerate. So this is the amount of work, and I just wanted to explain that we want to put that negative sign there because we're going in the opposite direction of the field. So how do we figure out the total amount of work? We figured out the amount of work to get it from here to here, and I even drew it much bigger than it would be. These drs, this is an infinitely small change inwards. And then we're taking the integral of minus k, q1, q2 over r squared dr. All of these are constant terms up here, right? So we could take then we had a minus, we took the antiderivative and they canceled out. So we have k, q1, q2 times the antiderivative evaluated at five, so 1 over five, right, r to the negative one, so 1 over r.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is think a little bit about what happens to some type of projectile, maybe a ball or a rock, if I were to throw it up straight up into the air. So to do that, and what I want to do is I want to plot its distance relative to time. So there's a few things that I'm going to tell you about my throwing of the rock in the air the left hand side you get acceleration, and on the right hand side right over here you get the same quantity G. And the whole reason why I did this is when we look at the little G it really comes from the universal law of gravitation. And you can really view it as measuring the relative to the distance between that object and the center of the earth that to make the math simple when we're at the when we're at or near the surface of the earth including in our atmosphere we can assume it is constant we can assume it is constant remember that little g right over here, if we want to give its direction, is negative, is negative 9.8 meters per second squared. So we have the acceleration due to gravity. So the acceleration due to gravity is going to be negative 9.8 meters per second squared. And I want to when we're dealing, not too far from the surface of the earth, we can make that assumption. Assuming we have a constant acceleration. But this right here, once again, we don't have what our final velocity is right over here. These two term, these two, if you combine them, become 2vi, 2 times my initial velocity, and then divided by this 2, plus all of this'll just write time there, but it's really change in time. And you know, it's not super wrong if there's just a T here, but change in time is a little bit more accurate. And then plus, you have one half, that's the same thing as dividing by two, plus one half times the acceleration times the acceleration times, we have a delta T times delta T.\", 'Physics'], [\" Good afternoon. We've done a lot of work with vectors and in a lot of the problems when we launch something into, you know, in the projectile motion problems or when we were doing the inclined lane problems, we always broke, you know, I always gave you a vector like I would draw a vector like this. I would say, you know, something has a velocity of 10 meters per second. It's at a 30 degree angle. And then I would break it up into the x and y components.use, and you would get back to this. But we've reviewed all of that, and you should review the initial vector videos. But what I want you to do now, because this is useful vector. It just goes straight in the x direction, it has no y component, and it has a magnitude of 1. And so this is i. And we does that work? Well, this vector here, let's call it V, right? This vector V is the sum of its X component plus its Y component, right? When you add vectors, you can put them head to tail like this, and that's the sum. So hopefully knowing what we already know, we knew that the vector V is equal to its X component, its X component, plus its Y component. And when you 30 degrees, so I think that's what, like, five square roots of three or something like that. So we can write v sub x as, we could write v sub x. I keep switching colors to keep things interesting. We can write v sub x is equal to 10 cosine of 30 degrees times, that's the degrees, times the unit vector i. Let me just stain that color so you don of this vector j of the unit vector j. And what multiple is it? Well, it has length 5 while the unit vector has just length 1. So it's just 5 times the unit vector j. So how can we write the vector v? Well, we know the vector v is the sum of its x component and its y component. And we also know, so this is a whole vector v, what's its x component? Well, its x component can be written as of analytical mode and non-graphical mode. And what makes this very useful is that if I can write a vector in this format, I can add them and subtract them without having to resort to visual means. And what do I mean by that? Let me.

That is four ohms that I have another resistor here. Let's just make it simple, 1 ohm. And, I don't know, just to make the numbers reasonably easy. I am doing this on the fly now. That's a positive terminal, negative terminal. Let's say that the voltage difference is, I don't know, 20 volts. So 1 over r is equal to 4 plus 2 is equal to 8 over 16. The numbers are working out is equal to 1 half. So that equivalent resistance is 2. So we had a two ohm and a one ohm series of those simplified to three ohms. Well now this is getting really simple. So what do these two resistors simplify to? Well, one over their combined resistance of both of these in parallel is actually half of either one of these resistance. I encourage you to think about that some more. I'll give you some intuition of what's actually going on with the electron. Although I'll do a whole video on resistivity. Okay, so let's, we said those two resistors combined. I wanted to lead all of that.

So we don't have, if we just had a constant velocity for this entire time, we could just multiply that times however long it's traveling and it would give us the displacement. But here our velocity is changing. But lucky for us, we learned, well what's our initial velocity? We're assuming we're starting at a standstill, plus zero, all of that over two. So our average velocity in this situation, 78 divided by two is 39 meters per second. And the value of an average velocity, if we have, you know, in this situation, actually average velocity in one given the numbers in this example. And the distance traveled is the area under this curve up to 78 seconds because that's how long it takes for it to take off. So the distance traveled is this area right over here, which we covered in another video, or we give you the intuition of why that works and why distance is area under a velocity timeline.

So that begs the question, what is the effect of one current carrying wire don't know the magnitudes of the currents or anything just yet, but what's going to happen? What will be the net effect on, let's say this wire, let's say for some reason this wire is fixed or, well we could say they're floating in space, but it, you know, it's effect keeps going out to infinity, although it gets much weaker as we learned. It's proportional with inversely proportional with R. But this is the field of I1. I could draw these. I don't want to crowd my page up too much. And then on this side of I1 what happens? Wellused by this magnetic field, by magnetic field 1. So it will be equal to I2, the magnitude of this current, times L, where L is, because you can't just say, oh well, what is the effect on this scalar, so that's not going to affect the direction. What's the direction of L2? This is L2, let me, I didn't label it L2 on the diagram. What's the direction of L2? Well, it's up, and then the direction of B cross product. So anyway, this is the direction of L2. The magnetic field, we already know, goes into the page. So my index finger is going into, oh, it's my middle finger is going into the page. And my thumb is in the direction of the force on the magnetic field. So that's the direction of the force. So there you have it. If this current is moving in this direction and its field is, we know from this wraparound rule, it pops out here and to be doing here. It's going to be popping out. All right, I just did the wraparound. I'll take this wraparound, wrap it around that wire. So that's the field of I2. So then we can write down that the force, and let's take, I don't know, this is some distance. Let's call that L thing. So my index finger in the direction of I1, my index finger in the direction of L1, which is the same as I1, and then my middle finger is going to do what the magnetic field is doing. So my middle finger is actually going to point straight up, and then my other fingers are just going to do what they do. And so now you're looking at the palm of my hand and my thumb.

And that is because torque is defined as the cross product between the radial distance from thing as r, and the magnitude of r is equal to 10. At some distance 10 from the pivot, I apply some force F, and F I will do in yellow. I apply this force? And when we learn torque, when we learn moments, we realize really the only hard part about these problems is that you don't just multiply the entire rotational force times the distance from the axis rotation. You have to multiply the component of that force that is actually doing the rotation, is square root of three, this is pi over three radians, or 60 degrees, and this is a right angle. This is pi over three, and it's hard to read. What is this length right here? What's the 30, 60, 90 triangle? And we know that this length here, I mean, there's a couple of ways you could think the distance. And remember, I just drew this vector here just to show you the component. I could just shift the vector here because this is actually where the force is being applied. You could draw that same vector here because you can shift vectors around. So this is also 3-halve newtons. And maybe that makes it a little these are all scalar quantities, right? So these don't specify the direction. The direction is completely specified by this unit vector. Now unit vector is just a vector of magnitude 1 that's pointing in some direction. Well look, this cross product, this part of it, the part that just gives us magnitudes, we just calculated that using what we knew before of Torx, the out if that vector pops out or pops into the page? We use the right hand rule. The right hand rule we take R is our index finger. F is our middle finger. And then whichever direction our thumb points in tells us whether or not we are the direction of the cross product. So let's draw it. That's the problem I've done on the other side of my, and then I could keep drawing. But hopefully that makes some sense. This is my index finger, this is the middle finger. My thumb is pointing out of the page. So that tells us that the torque is actually pointing out of the page. So the direction of this unit vector n is going to be out of the page, and we could signify that by a circle with a dot.\", 'Physics'], [\" Everything we've done so far has been stationary fluids or static fluids and we've been dealing with static pressure because all of the, you know, we were trying to figure out what happens when everything's in a steady state. So now let's work on what happens when the fluid is actually moving. So let's imagine a pipe. Let me draw a pipe. Let's say one end of the pipe has a larger area than the other end or at least a different area. Let me draw. So this is one end of the pipe with the velocity v in. Let's think about how much volume moves into the pipe after t seconds. So after t seconds, if you think about it're working at. So what is the volume of this cylinder of water? So the volume in over the t seconds is equal to the area come out of the pipe, right? So that must equal the volume out, right? So whatever comes into the pipe has to equal the volume coming out of the pipe. And one assumption we're assuming is in this fraction of time that we're dealing with is also that there's no friction in this liquid or in this fluid that it actually, you know, it doesn't, what's the volume out over that period of time? Well, similarly, we could draw this bigger cylinder, right? That's the area out. And after T seconds, how much water has come out? Well, whatever water was here at the beginning of our time period will now be some distance to the, we'll have come out, right? And we can kind of time this cylinder, the volume in this cylinder has to equal the volume in this cylinder. So maybe it's not as wide or something like that. But their volumes are the same. You can't get more or less water, you can't get more water here all of a sudden than what's going in. And likewise, you can't put more water into the left side than what's coming out of the right side because it's incompressible. So these two volumes equal each other. So we have this amount of volume coming in and it's the same as coming in as coming out. So what is the volume per second? Well it's this big capital V I per amount of time and we call that flux and we'll learn a lot about flux especially when we start doing vector calculus. But flux is just how much of something crosses a surface in amount of time. How much of volume crosses a surface in amount of time.\", 'Physics'], [\" I'm going to do a couple of more moments of force problems, especially because I think I might have bungled the terminology in the previous video because I kept confusing clockwise with counterclockwise.

Actually, now I'm going to keep it all the same color and then we'll use colors to differentiate between clockwise and counterclockwise so I don't bungle everything up again. So let's say I have a 10 Newton force here andwise moments? Well this clockwise is this direction, right? That's the way a clock goes. So this is clockwise, that is clockwise.. 100 plus 20 plus 160 is equal to, what's 50 times 8? That's what? 400 plus 30 plus 10 F. What is this? Two, 50 times 8, right? There's blew out your speakers with that sneeze. But anyway, we assumed that it was going in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math we got a negative number, so that means it's actually operating in the clockwise direction at 15 Newtons at a distance of 10 from the moment arm. Hopefully that't want it to edit and undo. Let's say I place a box there. And the box is also, let's say the box weighs, I don't know, it says like, the whole table would rotate in the counterclockwise direction. Or the other way, if this leg started to weaken and started to buckle and couldn't hold its force, the table would rotate down this way and it would rotate around the other leg, assuming that the other meter of the box. Let's say that this distance, let's say that between the leg and the center mass is two meters. And so this is also two well, but isn't this leg exerting some force? Well sure it is, but its distance from our designated axis is zero. So its moment of force is zero, right? Any, if it is exerting a million pounds or a million newtons, its moment of force or its torque would be zero because it's at, its moment arm distance is zero. So we can ignore it, which makes things simple. So those here must be 35 Newtons. And so there's a couple of ways we can think about it. If this leg is supporting 35 Newtons, right? And we have a total weight here of 120 Newtons, right? Our total weight, the weight of the top of the table plus the bookshelf that's 120 Newtons. So the balance of this must be supported by something or someone. So the balance of it is going to be supported by this leg.\", 'Physics'], [\" In this video I want to talk a little bit about acceleration. Acceleration, and this is probably an idea that you're somewhat familiar, whether at least you've heard the term used here or there. Acceler told you the definition of acceleration. It's a change in velocity over time. So the acceleration, and once again, acceleration is a vector quantity. You want to know not only what's our change in velocity? So, our final velocity is 60 miles per hour. Our final velocity is 60 miles per hour. And our original velocity was zero miles per hour. So, it's 60 minus zero miles per hour. And then, what is our time? What is our time over here? either put seconds like this, or we could write per second. Per second. And let's just think about what this is saying. Then we could get it all into seconds, or we could all get into hours, whatever we like. This is saying that every second, this Porsche 911, can increase its velocity by 20 miles per hour. So its acceleration is 20 miles per hour per second. And actually, we's not as intuitive. But we can make this so it's all in one unit of time. Although you don't really have to, you can change this so that you get rid of maybe the hours in the denominator and the best way to get rid of an hour in the denominator is by multiplying it by something that has hours in the numerator. So hour and seconds. And we can simplify this a little bit, divide the numerator and the denominator by 10, you get two over 360, or you could get this as the same thing as one over driving that Porsche and you were to look at the speedometer for that Porsche and if the acceleration was constant it's actually not going to be completely constant. And if you looked at the speedometer let me draw it. So this would be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,\", 'Physics'], [\" So we have some race cars racing right here and I have an interesting question to ask you. If we assume that these cars are making this turn right over here, that all of them are making this turn at a constant this, the difference between speed and velocity starts to matter. Speed being a scalar quantity, only having a magnitude and velocity being a vector quantity, having speed with a direction, having a magnitude and a direction. And to think about, let's take a top view of this thing and then I think it'll become a little bit clearer the difference between speed and velocity and why these things are accelerating. So if I were to take to the direction of the velocity? Remember, velocity is a vector quantity. It has magnitude and direction. So up here, at this one, it's starting to enter the curve, it's going in this direction. And you tend to show vectors by arrows like this. And what you do is, the arrow is going in the direction of the velocity in this case. And normally you draw the length of the arrow shows what is the velocity, the magnitude of the direction of its velocity would be constant. And the car would just keep going in that direction. So somehow, the car's direction is changing inward, over and over and over again. And so this is just kind of a little bit of a trick question. Something for you to think about. We're going to discuss the math in more detail in future videos. But what's happening here is the car is actually\", 'Physics'], [\" I mentioned in the last several videos that the coefficient of kinetic friction tends to be less. Sometimes it will be roughly equal to the coefficient of static friction. But this might lead you to at least a question that I've had in my mind and I still have to some degree. Is why is the coefficient of kinetic friction lower or why can it be lower? And the current best theory that one I can visualize in my head and based on the reading that, is why should the coefficient of friction here, why should the coefficient of static friction, so this is, so here, since this is stationary, what's under play is the coefficient of static friction, why should that be larger than the coefficient of hopefully this video also emphasizes that all of these forces and all of this contact that we're talking about in these videos, and it's actually of just a lot of free space pushing on a lot of other free space through the electromagnetic force. But anyway, we're talking about friction here. So if you were to really zoom in here when this thing is stationary, you have the surfaces aren't looks like that. This is, they're supposed to be the same surface. But once it's moving, it's kind of over, it can't, it's not sitting in these ruts anymore. The whole thing is moving, so it's kind of sliding across the top. And so now it might look something like this. I'm if you want to accelerate it you're going to have to keep breaking these bonds and so that's essentially the force of friction that you're overcoming. Here you might have those same bonds and not only do you have those same bonds but you also have to overcome these ruts or these little you know these little ragged parts that have a time to settle into these little nooks that you have to overcome even more. So that's the intuition and you know this is actually still an area of research so it's not like this you know cut and dry thing and it's a fun thing.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. I'll now do another conservation of energy problem. And this time I'll add another twist. So far everything we've been doing, energy was conserved by the law of conservation. But that's because all of the forces that we're acting in these systems were conservative forces. And now I'll introduce you to a problem that has a little bit of friction. And we'll see that some of the energy gets lost to friction. And we can think about it a little bit. Where does that energy go? So let's say, and I'm getting this problem from the University of friction and then we have to figure out the normal force and all of that, they're just telling us what is the drag of friction or how much is actually friction acting against this rider's motion. We could think a little bit about where that friction is coming from. So the force of friction is equal to 60 New height? Well here we're going to have to break out a little trigonometry. We need to figure out this side of this triangle. If we consider this whole thing a triangle. Let's see. We want to figure out the opposite. We know the hypotenuse and we know this angle here. So the sine of this angle is equal to opposite over hypotenuse. So SOH, sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So going back to the potential energy, we have the mass times the acceleration of gravity times the height times 43.6 and this is equal to, now I can use just my regular calculator since I don't have to figure out trig functions anymore. So 90, make sure so you can see the whole thing, times 9 let me just write initial energy is equal to the energy wasted in friction, energy wasted in friction, your work is negative. So in this case, we could say the work of friction. So another way of thinking of this problem is energy initial is equal to the, or you could say the energy initial plus the negative work of friction, right? head. So that gives us 8,455 joules is equal to the final energy. And what is all the final energy? Well, by this time the rider's gotten back to, I guess we could call this C level. So all of the energy wasn't completely conserved. Some of the energy you could say was eaten by friction and actually that energy didn't disappear into a vacuum. It was actually generated into heat. And it makes sense if you slid down a slide of sandpaper your pants would feel very warm by the time you got to the bottom of that. But the friction of this, they weren't specific on where the friction came from but it could have come from the gearing within the bike. It could have come from the wind. Maybe the bike actually\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. When I left off, I was hiring a little bit, but we had hopefully come to the conclusion that if I have a simple lever like I have here, and I know the distances from where I'm applying the force to the fulcrum, to the pivot, and I know the distance from the pivot to where the machine is essentially applying the force, or the machine being the lever in this situation, I know the relationship between the two forces I am capable of applying is only 10 Newton's. So I want my force to be multiplied by 10 to lift this force. So let's figure out what would happen. My input force is 10. And I want to figure out the distance to the force. So my input force is 10. And let's call this the input distance. And I will be able to apply 10 Newtons here, which is my maximum strength, 10 Newtons downwards, and I will lift 100 Newtons object. And what's the trade off though? Nothing just pops out of thin air. The trade off is that I am going to have to push down for a much longer distance, for actually 10 times the distance, as this object is going to move up. And once again, I know that because the work in has to equal the workout. I can't, problems where you can compound to this other side. So this quantity 7 Newton's times 35 meters is the moment and that is going to be equal to the moment on this side, the output moment. So that is equal to 5 meters times the force that I'm lifting or the lifting force of the machine.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome to the presentation on moments. So just if you were wondering, I have already covered moments. You just may not have recognized it because I covered it in mechanical advantage and torque. But I do realize that when I covered it in mechanical advantage and torque, I think I maybe overcomplicated it. And if anything, I didn't cover some force here and the forces, the forces that we care about, and this was the exact same case with torque because they're essentially the same thing, the forces we care about are the forces that are perpendicular to the distance from our This whole thing, since it's pivoting here, is going to rotate clockwise. The only way that it's not going to rotate clockwise is if I have something keep. So right now, this end is going to want to go down like that. And the only way that I can keep it from happening is if I exert some upward force here. So let's positive, and this is a counterclockwise rotation in the example that I've drawn here. And if we have a clockwise rotation, it has a negative torque, and that's just the convention we did, and that's because torque is a pseudo vector, but I don't want to confuse you right now. What you'll see is that these moment problems are actually quite, quite straightforward. So let's do a couple. It always becomes a squared. So what is the downward force here? What is the downward force? It's going to be the mass times the acceleration, so it's going to be 50 newtons. And let's say that the distance, the moment arm distance, or the lever arm distance here, and I'll let's say that this distance right here is 10 other. So we could do it a couple of ways. We could say that 50 newtons, the moment in the counterclockwise direction, issue. So this is the pivot. And let's say I have need to figure out what force I need to apply here upwards or downwards. I actually don't know because I'm doing this on the fly to make sure that this whole thing doesn't rotate. So to make sure this whole thing doesn't rotate, essentially what we have to say is that this is also counterclockwise times six. 50 times six. And those are all of our counterclockwise moments, and that has to equal the clockwise moments. So clockwise moments, let's see, we have five newtons that in the clockwise direction. And then we have plus six newtons times three, plus six times three. And then we're just assuming, we don't know for sure our force, our force, and let's say we're applying the force, I should have told you ahead of time so you can do this problem. Let's apply a 13.10 Newton force, 10 meters away, which will generate 132 Newton meters moment in the counterclockwise direction, which will perfectly offset all of the other moments.\", 'Physics'], [\" In this video I want to talk a little bit about Newton's first law of motion. And this is a translation from Newton's Principia from Latin into English. So the first law, everybody persists in a state of being at rest. So state of being at rest or moving uniformly straight forward except in some force being applied to it. So clearly a rock will be at rest unless there's some force applied to it. Unless someone here tries to push it or roll it or do something have two forces that act on something and they might balance out. For example, I could push on this side of the rock with a certain amount of force. And if you push on this side of the rock with the exact same amount of force, the rock won't move. And the only way that it would move if there's a lot more force on one side than on the unless it's being acted on by an unbalanced force. What's less obvious is the idea that something moving uniformly straightforward, which is another way of saying something having a constant velocity. Constant velocity. What go forever unless the engine keeps burning fuel and to drive and consuming energy. So what are they talking about? Well, in all of these examples, and I think this is actually a pretty brilliant insight for all of these fellows, is that all of these things would have gone on forever. The ball would keep going forever. This ice keep it from going on forever. Same thing with the ball being tossed to the air. Obviously at some point it hits the ground because of gravity, so that's one force acting on it. But even once it hits the ground, it doesn't keep rolling forever once again because of the friction. Because of the frictions, especially if there's grass here, the grass is going to stop it from going. And even while it's in theper obvious but on a whole other level it's completely not obvious, especially this moving uniformly straightforward. And just to make the point clear, if gravity disappeared and you had no air and you threw or throw a ball, that ball literally would keep going in that direction forever unless some other unbalanced force acted to stop it. And another way to think about it, another way to think about it, and this is an example that you\", 'Physics'], [\" We learned in the videos on torque that torque it equals, let me actually draw a picture. So you remember what we're talking about with torque. So let's say, so that's the arm, let's torque and you'll get it spinning. Or if something is spinning already, if you apply torque in the direction that it's spinning, it'll spin faster. Or if you go in the opposite direction, it'll spin slower. And what I'm showing you here is that what happens if you apply no torque? Well, if you apply no torque. So this force is zero. There's no force applying here. And whatever this object's velocity was, is tangential velocity, it's going to stay that velocity. It's just going to keep spinning at that velocity. If I apply more torque in a little, it'll go even faster. If I apply less torque, it'll slow down a little bit. But we know that this velocity times the distance is constant. And actually, I don't know why I took this m out. We know that the D, put it on the side. So let's write that here. M times D W, I just replaced the V times D is equal to a constant, assuming that we have no net torque on the system. And so what does that get us? same thing as mass times change in angular velocity times r. Change in time, and then there's another r. That's this r. Because velocity is angular velocity times r, and we're assuming r doesn't change. So any change in velocity is just going to be a change in the angular velocity. And then we would get the same thing that we just got here. If we have no net I Actually, let's make this radius a different number. Let's call it 8 feet, just so you know what I'm doing. So it's angular velocity is 10, and then its radius is 8, so times 64, so it equals 640 times the mass. This is its angular momentum. Now what happens if this arm, for whatever reason, shortens per second. When I have the radius, when I got half as close to the center of my rotation, I'm actually spinning around four times as much. And that's because this term is a quadratic term. And this makes, you probably have observed this behavior before. When you see the ice skater skating around and they're spinning with their arms wide open.\", 'Physics'], [\" Newton's first law tells us that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object with a constant velocity will keep having that constant velocity unless it's affected by some type of net force. Or you actually could say an object with constant velocity, constant velocity will stay having a constant velocity unless it's affected by net force because really this takes into consideration the situation where an object is rest. You could force, it might change that constant velocity. But how does it change that constant velocity? Well, say I have a brick right here, and it is floating in space. Newton's second law tells us, and it's pretty nice for us, that the laws of the universe, or at least a first year physics course you can really just imagine how much stuff there is. Weight as we'll see in a future video is how much that stuff is being pulled down by the force of gravity. So weight is a force. Mass is telling you how much stuff there is. And that's good that a newton is the same thing as kilogram meters per second squared because that's exactly what you get on this side of the formula. So let's have a force of 10 newtons and it is acting on a mass. Let's say that the mass is 2 kilograms and I want to know the acceleration. I want to know the acceleration. I want to know the acceleration. And once again have kilograms canceling with kilograms. Your left hand side, you get 5 meters per second squared. And then that's equal to your acceleration. Now, just for fun, what happens if I double that force? Well, then I have 20 newtons. I'll actually work it out.\", 'Physics'], [\" So I've got a rocket here and this rocket is going to launch a projectile, maybe it's a rock of some kind, with the velocity of 10 meters per second and the direction of that velocity is going to be 30 degrees upwards from the horizontal or the angle between the direction of the launch and the horizontal is 30 once again, the assumption that we're making in this video is that air resistance is negligible. Obviously, if there was significant air resistance, this horizontal velocity would not stay constant while it's traveling through the air. But we're going to assume that it does, that it does not change, that it is negligible. We could assume that we're doing this experiment on the moon if we wanted to have a, if we want to figure out the opposite. We have the hypotenuse. So once again, we write down, so kah, so kah, toa. Sign is opposite over hypotenuse. So we know that forgot the units there, so it's 5 meters per second is equal to the magnitude is equal to the magnitude of of this. So we're talking only in the vertical, let me do all of the vertical stuff, the mood and the blue. So vertical, we're dealing with the vertical here. So our initial velocity in the vertical direction, our initial velocity in the vertical direction is going to y direction is going to be our final velocity, negative five meters per second, minus our initial velocity, minus five meters per second, which is equal to negative 10 meters per second. So how do we use this information to figure out how long it's in the air? Well, we know, we know that our are in the air, we just divide both sides by negative 9.8 meters per second squared. So we get, let's just do that, I want to do that in that same color. So I do it in, that's not, well, that's close enough. So we get negative 9.8 meters per second squared, negative 9.8 meters per second squared, that cancels out. And I get my change in time, and I'll just get the calculator. I have a negative divided by negative, so that's a positive, which is good, if we assume that it maintains its horizontal component of its velocity the whole time, we just assume we can just multiply that times our change in time and we'll get the total displacement in the horizontal direction. So to do that, we need to figure out this horizontal component, which we didn't do yet. So this is the component of our velocity in the x direction or the horizontal direction. Once again, we break out a little bit of trigonometry. This you might not remember the cosine of 30 degrees. You could use a calculator for this. Or you can just, if you do remember it, you know that it's the square root of 3 over 2. Square root of 3 over 2. So to figure out the actual component, I'll still have to get a calculator out if I want to, well I don't have to use it, do it just yet. Because I have 10 times the square root of 3 over 2, which is going to be 10 divided by 2 is 5. So it's going to be 5 times the square root of three times 1.02 gives us 8.83 meters just around it. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, this is going to be, oh sorry, this is going to be equal to 8.8, is that what the number I got? 8.83, 8.83 meters.\", 'Physics'], [\" The goal of this video is to explore some of the concepts or formulas you might see in a traditional physics class, but even more importantly to see that they're really just common sense ideas. So let's just start with a simple example. Let's say that, and for the sake of this video, just so I don't have to keep saying this is the magnitude of the velocity, this is the direction of the velocity, et cetera, et cetera, let's just assume that if I have a positive number, that it means, for, let's say we do this for a duration of four, I'll use the same four, I'll just use S. So I don't use seconds and then second and then S different places. So S for this video is seconds. So what I want to do is think about how far, how three, four. So this is my delta t. So my final velocity is going to be right over there. So my final velocity is going to be right over there. I'll write it down here just because it's getting in the way of this word velocity. And so this is my final velocity. And just to make it clear what the numbers, these numbers really could be anything. I'm just picking these to make it concrete in your mind. You have 5 meters per second plus 4 seconds times our acceleration of 2 meters per second squared So this right up here is 13 meters per second. So I'll take a little pause here. Hopefully that's intuitive. And the whole point of that is to show you that this formula that your change in time is 4 seconds. So if you go 5 meters per second, for 4 seconds, you're going to go 20 meters. This right here is 36 meters. That minus our initial velocity. These are all vectors. They're just positive, telling us we're going to the right. And we just don't multiply the base times the height. That would give us the area of this entire rectangle. We have to take it by half because the triangle is only half of that rectangle. So times one half. So times one half. And so this is 2 times our initial velocity minus 1 1 1 2 times our initial. I want to do that in blue. Sorry, I'm having trouble changing colors today. Minus 1 1 1 2 times our initial velocity. And now what does this simplify to? We have something plus 1 1 2 times something vf, vi, no that's not the right color, vi plus vf, plus vf. So this is interesting, the distance we traveled is you just need to know the initial velocity and the final velocity average the two and then multiply that times the time that goes by. So in this situation, our final velocity is 13 meters per second. Our initial velocity was 5 meters per second. So you have 13 plus 5 is equal to 18. You divide that by 2.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's explore the repercussions of this equation some more. So let's say, what was the equation? It was that the force of a magnetic field on a moving charge particle is equal to the charge, that's not what I wanted to do, is equal to the charge of the particle, and that's just a scalar quantity, times the velocity, the cross angle in time. So we could take the scalar quantity out, it doesn't affect this vector cross product. So what we get left with is force is equal to charge per time times, and this is just a regular time, because this is just a number, it's not a vector, times the cross could almost prove it to yourself if you ever forget it. But let's see if we can use this to figure out the effect that a magnetic field has on a current carrying wire. So let me, actually I probably want to put this up the screen. And those are even easier to draw, they're just X's. Now why is it an X? Because you're looking at the rear end of an arrow. That's why it's an X. And that's why a circle with a dot means a know, I'm just making up numbers, five amperes, or five coulombs per second. Now my question to you is, what is reality because they're almost more an idea than an object. But it's always good to remember that when the current is flowing in this direction, that would be true because if they were positive charges moving, but we know it's negative charges moving in the opposite direction. Or you could think of it as maybe holes. Well, I don't want to get into that. But anyway, the current, you can visualize it if you like, is positive't specify it right now. We can see that's the magnitude of L. Actually, let's just let me write it. Well, two meters times the magnetic field, one Tesla. And so, when you take a cross product of something, this is just a reminder. L cross B, that's equal to the magnitude of L times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude of B times the magnitude then the only question left is what is the direction of the force that the magnetic field is exerting? And this is where we break out the right hand rule. And it's no different. You can just imagine one of the positive particles moving in that direction and just use the right hand rule. So let's take our hand out.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say I have a magnetic field popping out of this video. So these little brown circles show us the tips of the vectors popping out of this of our screen. And then in that magnetic field I have this wire, this off white colored wire, and sitting on that off white colored wire I have a charge is going to be zero. So if the velocity is zero, we know that the magnitude of a cross product is the same thing as, so Q is, that's just a scalar quantity, so that's to move to the left with the velocity v. And now things get interesting. The charge is moving to the left with the velocity v, so now we can apply the first magnetism formula that we learned. We can apply this formula. So what's going to happen to this charge? Well, the force of the charge is going to be the charge times the magnitude of the velocity across let me use a suitable color, the velocity is that way. The magnetic field is popping out of the page. So the force, create on the particle, on this charged particle or on this charge, due to the magnetic field is going to go in the direction of your thumb. So the direction of the force is in this direction. So the force. So it's going to induce the current in the wire and actually this is how electric generators are generated. And I'll do a whole series of videos on how you, you know, if you have a, using coal or steam or hydro power, how that turns, essentially that turns these generators around and it induces current and that's how we get electricity from all of these, you know, various energy sources that essentially just make turbines turn. But anyway, let's go back to what we were doing. So let so the net force is this up here, Q, and I'll leave some space, V cross B, times the distance. And the distance right here is just a scalar quantity, so we could put it out front, right? Q times L times V cross B, right? This is Q, V cross B is the four times the distance, that's just the work done. Now, how much or these charges are going to start moving in this direction as if there is a voltage difference, as if there is a potential difference between this point and this point, as if this is a positive voltage terminal and this is a minus voltage terminal. So there's actually going to be a voltage or a perceived voltage difference between this point and this point that will start making the current flow. Let's say you didn't even know that there was a magnetic field is actually impacting a force on this wire that is causing the current to move. We call it EMF, right? So we could say that the EMF, the electromotive force, or the voltage across from here to here, but they're really the same thing is equal to the distance of the wire that's in the magnetic field times the velocity that you're of the wire in the magnetic field 12 meters times, well, when we're just taking the cross product, we know that the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. So we don't have to worry about sine theta because theta is already 90 degrees. So we just have to worry about the magnitudes. So it's going to be 12 meters times the velocity, which is 3 meters per second, times the magnetic field, or the magnitude of the magnetic field, that's two Teslas. And so the EMF is 12 times\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. And I want to introduce you really just a different notation for writing vectors. And then we'll do that same problem or a slight variation on that problem using the new notation. And this is just to expose you to things so that you don't get confused. If your teacher uses a different notation than what I've been doing. So when we did the unit vectors, we learned that we can express a vector as a component of its x and y component. So a plus, you write a comma. Okay, let's clear this. And I'm going to do a slight variation. This was actually the second part of that problem. My cousin gave these problems to think for the simplicity of the problem they're just saying that the X component of the ball's velocity right after you hit it increases by 5 meters per second. I think that's their point. So let's go back and do the problem the exact same way that we did it last time but we'll use a different it. So we can split it up into the x and the y components. The y component is 120 sine of 30 degrees. And then the x component is 120 cosine of 30 degrees. And then they also tell us, so that's just the x component after I hit it. But then they say there's this 120 times the sine of 30. Well, this is sine of 30 is 1-2. So this is 60. Oh, sorry. This should be brackets. Although some people actually write the parentheses there. So it looks just like coordinates. But I like to keep it with these brackets so that you don't think that these are coordinates acceleration vector, 0 minus 32. And it should be, this is actually a little cleaner way of writing it, but this is exactly what we did when we did it with unit vectors instead of writing the Is and J's, we're just writing the numbers and brackets here's the y components? 4 plus 60 t minus 16 t squared. And there we go. We've defined the position vector at a function of 164, and then what's 60 times 3.2? 60 times 3.2 is equal to 192. So what do we get? We get 192, sorry, we have 192 plus 4, plus 4, minus 164, right? Minus 164 is equal to 32.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is show you a very cool video and then pose a question. But I want to make sure that the video, everything's up and up in terms of the copyright laws. So the video I'm going to show you is from a show called the fifth gear that appears on channel five, I believe, in the United Kingdom. And I think I'm okay on good copyright grounds to claim fair use here because obviously the point of this, I'm going to ask a math question about the video that we're going to supersede it.

Let's see where the spring is naturally. So if I were not to push on the spring, it would stretch all the way out here. But in this situation, I've pushed on the spring so it has a displacement of x to the left. And we'll just worry about magnitude. So we won't worry too much about direction. So what I want to do is think a little bit. Well, first I want to graph how much force you have to apply. Well this was its natural state, right? And we know from, well, Hooke's law told us that the restorative force, the restorative force, I'll write a little r down here, the restorative force is equal to negative k, where k is the spring constant, times the displacement, right? That's the restorative force. So that's the force that the spring? Well, if we give 0 force, the spring will move. But if we just give a little bit of force, if we just give like infinitesimal super small amount of force, we'll compress the spring just a little bit, right? Because at that point, the force of compression is going to be pretty much 0. So when the spring is barely compressed, we're going to apply a little bit of force you apply at two meters. You would have been up to 2K, 2K, et cetera. And I think you see a line is forming. Let me draw that line. The line looks like something like that. And so this is how much force you need to apply as a function of the displacement of the spring from its natural rest state. And here I have positive x going to the right, but in this graph, let's figure out how much work we need to do to compress the spring, you know, I don't know. Let's say this is x not. So x is where it's a general variable. x not is a particular value for x. That could be tan or whatever. Let's see how much work we need. Each of these rectangles, right? Because the height of the rectangle is the force I'm applying and the width is the distance, right? So the work is just going to be the sum of all of these rectangles. And the rectangles I drew are just kind of approximations because they don't get right under the line. You have to keep making the rectangles smaller, smaller, smaller, and smaller and just sum up more and more and we're dealing with the triangle. So that equals 1 half k x0 squared. And for those of you who know calculus, that, of course, is the same thing as the integral of kx dx. And it should make sense. Each of these are little dx's. But I don't want to go too much into the calculus now to consider\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's review a little bit of what we had learned many many videos ago about gravitational potential energy and then see if we can draw the analogy which is actually very strong to electrical potential energy. So what did we know about gravitational potential energy? If we said this was the surface of the earth and we don't have to be on earth but it makes visualization easy. We could be anywhere that has gravity and the potential energy would be due to the gravitational field of has potential energy and if nothing's stopping and we just let go, that energy, well, with gravitational potential energy, the object will start accelerating downwards and a lot of that potential energy and eventually all of it will be converted to kinetic energy. So potential energy is energy that is being stored by an object situation or a kind of this notional energy that an object has by virtue of where it is. So in order for something to have to have an equal and opposite force to its weight to pull it up, otherwise it would accelerate downwards. I'd have to do a little bit more just to get it moving to accelerate it however much. But then once I get it just accelerating, essentially I would have to apply an upward force, which is equivalent to the downward force of gravity. And I would do it studied potential energy it seemed like there was kind of an absolute potential energy. But that's because we always assumed that the potential energy of something is zero at the surface of the earth and that we want the potential energy relative to the surface of the earth. So it would be kind of how much work does it take to take something from the surface of the earth to that height. But really we should be saying, well the potential energy of gravity, like this statement shouldn't be, you know, this the jump to electrical potential energy all that easier because you'll actually see it's pretty much the same thing. It's just the source of the field and the source of the potential is something different. So electrical potential energy, just when, you know, a positive charge is we're going to want to get away from it. So we know the electric field points upward and we know that it's constant, that if these were field vectors, that they're going to be the same size, no matter how far away we get from the field, as far as the source of the field. And I'm just going to pick't know. Three meters within this field. How much work? So we're gonna start here and we're gonna move it down towards the plate three meters and its ending position is going to be right here. Right, that's where it's when it's done. How much work does that take? Well, what is the force of the field right here? What is a like we did with gravity, you have to maybe do a little bit more than that, just accelerate a little bit, just so you have some net downward force. But once you do, you just have to completely balance the upward force. So just for our purposes, you have a 10-Newton force downward, and you apply that force for a distance of 3 meters. The work that you put to take this two Coulomb charge from here to here is going to be equal a sense of what it is, is equal to 30 joules. And how could that help us? Well if we also knew the mass, let's say that this charge had some mass, we would know that if we let go of this object by the time it got here that 30 joules would be essentially assuming that none of it got transmitted to heat or resistance or whatever.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. When I left off, I was rushing at the end of this problem because I tend to rush at the end of problems when I am getting close to the YouTube 10 minute limit. But I just wanted to review the end of it because I feel like I rushed it. And then actually continue with it and actually solve for the angle and introduce a little bit of a little more trigonometry. So just to review what we did, we said momentum is conserved. And in two dimensions, that means momentum is conserved in each of the dimensions. So we figured out what the initial momentum of the entire system was. And we said per second, which I wrote, right, what I wrote here. And then we figured out A's momentum in the B direction, and we said well that's just gonna be square root of three times 10, and that's 10 squared to three. And then we used that information to solve for B's momentum, because we said well B's momentum plus A's momentum in the X direction has to add although it's broken up into the x and y direction. Now if we wanted to simplify this, if we wanted to kind of write B's new velocity the same way that the problem gave us A's velocity, right? They told us A's velocity was two meters per second at an angle of 30 degrees. We now have to use this information to figure out B's velocity and the angle add them together, and this is the resulting vector, and I think you're used to that at this point. And now we have to figure out this angle, and this side. Well this side is easy, because this is a right angle, so we use Pythagorean Theorem, so this is going of the sides. So I don't know, let's use one that you feel comfortable with. Well, unless you sign. So sign of theta is equal to what? So katoa, sign is opposite over hypotenuse. So the opposite side is the y direction, so that's two over the hypot, it's an automatic calculator. So you can type in arc sign on Google of 0.625. Although I think there's the answer they give you will be in radians. So I'll take that answer. That'll be in radians and I want to convert to degrees so I multiply it times 180 over pi. That's just how I convert from radians to degrees. And let's see what I know I erased everything, ball A was had a mass of 10 kilograms, while ball B had a mass of 5 kilograms. So it makes sense, so let's think about just the y direction. Ball A, we figured out the y component of its velocity was 1 meters per second, 1 meter per second. And ball B's y component is 2 meters per second downwards. And does that make sense? Well, sure. Because their momentums have to add up to zero. There was no y component of the momentum.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's do a slightly more complicated two-dimensional projectile motion problem now. So in this situation, I here, let's say that that is nine meters. And so we're essentially launching this from a height of 25 meters. I know in the last video, even though I it in orange. The vertical component would look like, that's not orange. The vertical component will look like, the vertical component would look like this. And so the vertical component of the vector, what get that the magnitude of that side is going to be equal to, is equal to 90 times the sine of 53 degrees. Now, if we want to do the horizontal component, the horizontal side is adjacent to this cosine. So, cotoa, cosine is adjacent off at, it's gonna be the same velocity but in the opposite direction or the same magnitude of velocity but the opposite direction, because we're not going to the same elevation. What we could do is we can use the formula that we derived in the previous video. That the displacement, let me just copy and paste this a little bit lower so we can make things too much real estate, so at least it looks simple. Is equal to the initial velocity. We're dealing with just the vertical dimension here. So we're just dealing with the vertical here. And remember, it's quadratic equations is you get everything on the one side of this equation and then you either factor it out, but more likely in this situation we will use the quadratic formula, which we've proved in other videos and hopefully give you the intuition for it, to actually solve for the times where your elevation, where your displacement in the that in yellow, plus 16. All of this is equal to zero. And this once again is just a quadratic equation. We can find its roots and the roots will be But I'll just write it out here. Plus or minus the square root of b squared. So it's this quantity squared. So it is 90 sine of 53 degrees plus, I'm doing the plus version here because that'll give us the positive value, plus the square root of, the square root of, and I'll do this in parentheses, 90 sine of 53 degrees squared, that's that part right there. These two negatives cancel out. So I can say this a little bit and then let me replace this with a minus sign. So I'm going to look at the negative value because I want the positive time. And so now my numerator here is a negative value. And so this is actually what we care about. We care about the numerator as a negative value. You divide by negative 9.8. So you divide by negative 9.8.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is a calculus proof of the famous centripetal acceleration formula that tells us that the magnitude of centripetal acceleration, the actual direction will change. It's always going to be pointing inwards, but the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is equal to the magnitude of the velocity squared divided by the radius. I want to be very clear. This is a scalar assume that this thing is in an orbit with a radius of r. So the magnitude of our position vector, even though the direction is going to change, the magnitude of our position vector is not going to change. It's always going to have length r. So this is going in a circle of radius r. So I can write comes from basic trigonometry when we started, actually we started, I think, in a two-dimensional projectile motion, we saw how to break these vectors down into its components. And the y component of this vector, the y component of this vector is going to be r sine of theta. It's going to be the same thing as this vector, the magnitude right over there. So this is going to be r sine, sine of theta. So the position vector at unit vector, so that is going in the j direction. So now we have position as a function of theta, which is actually a function of time. So let's take the derivative of this thing right over here. So what is d, the derivative of our position vector, the derivative of our position vector with theta with respect to theta is going to be cosine of theta, and I'll write it as a function of time. And then do the chain rule, you also have to multiply that times the rate at which theta is changing with respect to t, times d theta dt, and this is going all going to be constant, and we can actually factor it out of this expression. So let's actually factor out a negative omega r from this expression right over here. So we can rewrite our velocity as a function of time is equal we're going to assume that the magnitude of this thing is constant, but the actual direction is changing. So this is the acceleration as a function of time, is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to, let me get my colors right, it's going to be equal, but we have a negative out front so it becomes positive sine of theta as a function of t. And then we have to do the chain rule, the derivative of theta with respect to t. We have to multiply by this. And that we could write d theta dt right here, but that once again is the same thing as omega. And all of that's being multiplied times the j is all of this business? If you just look at this part right over there. Well, r times this, especially if you distributed the r, that's exactly this thing right over here. In fact, if you distribute the r, you get exactly r cosine of theta as a function of t times ri unit vector plus r sine theta as a function of t times's take the magnitude. So that we're saying the acceleration vector is equal to this constant times the position vector. So let's take the magnitude of both sides of this thing, the magnitude of both sides, the magnitude of both sides of this thing. So then we get the magnitude of the acceleration vector, which I'm just going to call a sub c, is going to be equal to, so you could say the magnitude of angular velocity is equal to the magnitude of our velocity, or another way to think about it is the speed of our object, divided by the radius of the circle that it is going around. So we can substitute that right over here. So if we square it, so this is going to be V over R squared, and we saw that in the video on angular velocity times R, and this is all going to be the magnitude of our acceleration, which is really our centripetal acceleration, our inward\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video, we learned that the pressure at some depth in a fluid is equal to the density of the fluid times how deep we are in the fluid or kind of how high is the column of fluid above us times gravity. Now let's see if we can use I have mercury. And I don't know, mercury is like a silverish color. So I'll draw it as silver. So I have mercury. Mercury,, one of my favorite words, because it has two u's in a row. Anyway, what was I doing? Oh, okay, so we have this set up. So my question to you is, how high is this column of mercury going to go? How high is this column of mercury going to go? And first of all, let's just have the intuition as to why this thing is going up to begin with. So we have all this pressure from all of the is 13.6. That's often a daunting statement on a test where you know how to do all the math and all of a sudden you know what is specific gravity. All specific gravity is the ratio of how dense that object is, that substance to water. So all that Let's consider this point right here, which is essentially the base of this column of mercury. What we're saying is the pressure on the base of this column of mercury right here, the pressure at this point down, pressure down, has to be the same thing as the pressure up, right? Because the mercury isn't moving, we're in a static state. And we learned several videos ago that the pressure in is equal to the outside and pushing up here. So let's see. The density of mercury is this, 13.6,000, so 13,600 kilogram meters per meter cubed. That's the density. Times the height, we don't know what the height is, that's going to be in meters we divide both sides by 13,609.8, we get the height is equal to 103, we have a meters cubed in the denominator up here. We have a meters cubed in the denominator down here. And then we have kilogram meters per second squared here. And then we have a newtons up here. But what's a newton? A newton is kilogram meters squared per second. So when you divide, you have kilogram meters squared per second squared. Here you have kilogram meters per second squared. When you do all the division of the units, all you're left with is meters. So we have 0.77 meters per second squared.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's do one more example dealing with displacement velocity in time. So we have, if Marsha travels for one minute at five meters per second to the south, how much will she be displaced? And so we know that know, if it said zero minutes on her stopwatch when she started, at the end it'll say one minute, or if it said five minutes, and maybe it was 305 when she started, it would be 306 when she finished, it was really the change in time. Once again, I won't write the delta there, just because it keeps it, this is the way you, you, you, you most frequently see it, but I want to tell you that these are the same thing for the purpose of this problem, because sometimes you'll see the delta there. So the one minute, so the T right over here is that when we're talking about displacement, we're going to think about a magnitude of how much it's moved, so it'll be a distance of some kind and some direction. We have our direction here, but we don't want any other units there. And if we just multiply this over here, we have a minute over here, but we have seconds in the denominator. You can't just cancel out a minute in a second, so you can't just say that you're going to get five and have some weird thing here. So in order for it to all work out, you have And so your displacement is going to be equal to five times 60, and then your units left are meters, all the time units have canceled out, and then it's meters to the south. So meters to the\", 'Physics'], [\" So let's say we have a pipe again. This is the opening and we have fluid going through it and the fluid is going with a velocity of V1. The pressure entering the pipe is P1 and then the area of this opening of the pipe is A1. And then it's a pipe and it can the size of the pipe. Let's say that this is h2. So with that set up, and remember, there's fluid going through this thing. So with that set up, let's go back to what would keep showing up, which is the law of conservation of energy, which is in any closed system, the amount of energy that you put into something is equal to the amount of energy plus a kinetic energy output. But we could also, the initial energy in a system can also be done by work. So we just added work to this equation that says that the energy in is equal to the energy out. So with that information, let's see if we can do anything interesting with this pipe that I've drawn. So what's the work that's area, is equal to the input distance over that amount of time and that's velocity times time. Times velocity input times time. So the work input is equal to, just to, so the work input is equal to pressure divided by density. So the work that I'm putting into the system, I know I'm doing a lot of crazy things, but it'll make sense so far. The work that I'm putting into the system is equal to the input pressure times the amount of volume of fluid that moved over that period of time, and that volume of fluid is equal to the mass of the fluid that went in h1. And what's the initial kinetic energy of the fluid? Well that equals the mass of the fluid, this mass right here of that same cylindrical volume that I keep pointing1, times the mass divided by the density of the liquid, whatever it is. So this is work in plus, and what's the potential energy output side, right? So this is going to be equal to the work out, so that'll be the output pressure times the mass divided by the density plus the output potential\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say that I have a huge, maybe frozen over lake, or maybe it's a big pond, so I have a huge surface of ice over here, my best attempt to draw a flat surface of ice, and I'm gonna put two blocks of ice here. So I'm gonna put one block of ice just like this, one block of ice right over here or you could view this as a constant velocity of zero, or something that has a constant velocity? Well, Newton's first law says, well look, they're going to keep their constant velocity or stay stationary, which is a constant velocity of zero, unless there is some unbalance, unless there is 9.8 meters per second squared. So you multiply that times 5, you get 49 kilogram meter per second squared, which is the same thing as 49 Newtons. So this is a little bit of a conundrum here. Newton's first law says an object at rest will stay at rest, or an object at motion will stay in motion unless there is some unbalanced or be providing the counteracting force. And you are absolutely correct. The ice is providing the counteracting force in the opposite direction. So the exact magnitude of force, and it is in the opposite direction. And so if the force of gravity on each of these blocks of ice are 49 newtons downward, it is completely netted off by the force is the force when anything is resting on any surface that's perpendicular to that surface. And it's going to start to matter a lot when we start thinking about friction and all the rest. So what we'll see in future videos when you have something on an incline, and let's say I have a block on an incline like this, the normal force from the, I guess you could say the swedge on the block is going to be perpendicular, is going to be perpendicular to the surface. And if you really think about what's happening here, it's fundamentally an electromagnetic force. Because if you really zoom\", 'Physics'], [\" Before I continue, I want to introduce you to what might be an unfamiliar concept. Although if you've taken chemistry, you might know a little bit about it. It's called a mole. And this isn't the thing that grows on your face with a hair in it or the animal that digs it in your backyard. Although those are also called moles. But we're talking about the SI unit called a mole. And a mole is just a number. It's like saying, you know, a mole of something means a certain 23 of something. So it's a very large number of something. So normally we don't deal in moles of eggs. I don't think there have been a mole of eggs ever produced in the history of universe. 10 to the 23 is a very, very, very large number. So where is it useful? Well a mole is useful for counting atoms. And so what is a mole of atoms? Well it I was thinking about a mole of a molecule, I would figure out the atomic mass of the entire molecule. So what's an atomic mass number? Let me see if I can do a web search on a periodic table. See, of the, most of the atoms have roughly the same number of protons and neutrons. Some don't. Some, you know, you could have a carbon atom that has, you know, seven neutrons. You could have another one that has five, another one of Let me see when I'm running out of time. I have plenty of time. That pressure times volume is somehow proportional. It's somehow proportional. Let's call that K. And this is an arbitrary number. It's not some special constant. To the total kinetic energy, kinetic energy total of a system. Total. And we me see, 1 mole equals 6.022 times 10 to the 23, right? So I'm just saying, so this is just another way to write the number of molecules and then that's times temperature. And then if we rearrange it, PV equals NRT, we have a relationship that if I know the pressure be able to do 95% of problems, but you actually should have the intuition of how they work. But just remember that p over t is equal to a constant, or that if you change them, they relate to each other, that they all equal a constant. So p1 times v1 divided by t1 is equal to p2 times v2 divided by t2. And then you also should just need to memorize pv\", 'Physics'], [\" We've learned a little bit about gravity. We've learned a little bit about electrostatic. So time to learn about a new fundamental force of the universe. And this one is probably second most familiar to sounds very complicated and all of that. But in our classical Newtonian world, we treat them as two different forces. But. They said, oh, well, the side of the needle that is pointing to the Earth's North, let's call that the North Pole, and the point of the needle that's pointing to the South Pole, sorry, the point of the needle that's pointing to the Earth's geographic South, we'll call that the South Pole, or another way to put it if you have a magnet. The direction of the magnet or the side of the north. And magnetic south, I don't know exactly where that is, but it can kind of move around a little bit. It's not in the same place. So it's a little bit off the axes of the geographic north pole and the south pole. And this is another kind of slightly confusing thing is magnetic north is kind of the geographic location where the north pole of a magnet will point to. But that would actually be the south pole of that magnet. Right? And vice versa, the south pole of my magnet here is going to be attracted to Earth's magnetic south, which is actually the north pole of the magnet we call Earth. Anyway, I'll take Earth out of this notion, just like we had in electrostatics, that a magnet generates a field. It generates dipole. If I were to take this magnet, this one right here, and if I were to cut it in half, if I were to cut it in half, somehow, miraculously, they do have mass, but it starts to get fuzzy whether they're energy or mass, and then how does the ball of energy spin, et cetera, et cetera. So it gets very, very, almost metaphysical. So I don't want to go too far into it, and I frankly, I don't think you really can't get an intuition. It is almost, you know, it is a realm that we don't normally operate in. But even these large magnets you deal with, the magnetic field is generated by the electron spins inside of it, and by the actual magnetic field,\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say that I have a ramp made of ice. We can see maybe a wedge or some type of an inclined plane made of ice. And I'm gonna make everything of ice in this video so that we have negligible friction. So this right here is my ramp. It's made of ice. And this angle right over here, let's just go with 30 degrees. And let's say on this ramp made of ice, I have another block of ice. So this is a to gravity is going to be equal to 10 kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared downward. This 9.8 meters per second squared downward, that is the field vector for the gravitational field near the surface of the earth. I guess there's going to be some component that is parallel to the plane. I'll draw that in yellow, some component of the force of gravity that is parallel to the plane. And clearly, this is a right angle, because this is perpendicular to the plane, and this is parallel to the plane, so hypotenuse. Opposite over hypotenuse is equal to sine of an angle. And we did all the work over here. I don't want to keep repeating it. But I always want to emphasize that this is coming straight out of the plane or downward or let me just write into surface of plane, surface of the plane or the surface of the ramp and it's in this direction over here and I have to do this because it's a vector. I have to tell you what direction it's going in and the component of the force of But we know it's not going to accelerate. We know that there's this big wedge of ice here that is keeping it from accelerating in that direction. So at least in this dimension, there will be no acceleration. When I talk about this dimension, I'm talking about in the direction that is perpendicular to the surface of the plane. There will be no acceleration because this wedge is here. So the wedge is exerting to keep this block of ice from accelerating in that direction. We're not talking about accelerating straight towards the center of the earth, we're talking about accelerating in that direction. We broke up the force into kind of the perpendicular direction and the parallel direction. So you have this counteracting normal force and that's why you don't have the block plummeting or accelerating into the plane. And so if you divide both by mass, if you divide both of these, if you divide it by mass, so that's the same thing as dividing it by 10 kilograms, dividing by 10 kilograms, that will give you acceleration. That will give you our acceleration. So acceleration is 49 newtons divided by 10 kilograms in that direction, in this direction right over there. And 49 divided by 10 is 4.5\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back and if you are covering your eyes because you didn't want to see calculus I think you can open your eyes again. There shouldn't be any significant Displays of calculus in this video, but but just to review what we went over we just said okay if we have a spring and I drew it vertically this time But pretend like there's no gravity or maybe pretend like we're you know We're viewing we're looking at the top of a table because we we don't want to look at the effect of a spring and gravity We just want to look at a spring by itself so this could be in deep space or or something else But we're not thinking about gravity, but I drew it vertically just, and we can see the slope is very fast right here. And then we start slowing down again, slowing down, until we get back to this bottom A, and then we keep going back and up and down, up and down like that. And we showed that actually the equation for the masses position as a function of time is, and I'll X of t, and we use a little bit of differential equations to's figure out what this period is. Remember we said that after t seconds it gets back to its original position and then after another t seconds it gets back to its original position. Let's figure out what this t is. And that's essentially its period, right? What's the period of a function? Especially it's how long it takes to get back to your starting point or how long it takes for the whole cycle to happen once. So what is this t? So let me ask you is equal to 1. So the same thing is true. This function, x of t is equal to a, at what points? x of t is equal to a whenever this expression within the cos of this function. This is going to be equal to 2 pi times the square root of m over k. So if you, if someone tells you, well, I have a spring that I'm going to pull from some, you know k, all of that. All you have to really memorize is this. And even that, you might even have an intuition as to why it's true. You can even go to the differential equations if you want to reprove it to yourself. Because if you have this. So it's going to take the same amount of time to complete a cycle, just have a lower amplitude. So that's interesting to me. That how much I stretch it is not going to make it take longer or less time to complete one cycle. That's interesting. And so if I just told you that I actually start having an object compressed, right? So in that case,\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's make our circle a little bit more complicated now. So let's say I have a battery again, and let me do it in a different color just for a variety. That's the positive terminal, that's the negative terminal. Let's have this perfect conductor. Let's say this little segment right here. And so it's a perfect conductor. Well, let's look at this end. So you have all these electrons. This is a perfect conductor. So there's nothing stopping these electrons from just we assume that the wires are perfect conductors and all the resistance takes place in the resistor. So that's the first thing I want you to realize. And it makes things very, so for example, everywhere along this wire, this part of the wire, the voltage is constant. Everywhere along this wire, the voltage is constant. So that's the first thing I wanted you to realize. Let me erase some of this because I don't hit this resistor, then the next resistor, then the next resistor. At no point does the circuit branch off and has to choose whether I want to go down path A or path B. So this circuit is completely in series. And there's a couple of ways I can convince you that the current, let's. We know that they're evenly spread out, etc. And similarly, they might exit this resistor at a certain speed and then slow down even further as they bump into resistors here. But if they're going even slower at this point, then there would be a bottleneck here. So essentially, they would have to go at that rate throughout the whole thing. And another way to think about it is the to be equal to I1 times R1. I don't know why I put an R. It's not an I. I1 times R1. And similarly, if I measured the voltage from here to here, they really want to get here. But after they've bumped around a little bit and they get here, they've experienced some potential drop. So the electrons here actually are a little bit less eager to get here. And then once they've gone through here, maybe they're just tired of bumping around so much. And once they're here, they're a little bit less eager to get here. So there's a voltage drop across each same. So all of these i's are the same so we can just cancel them out, right? Divide both sides by that i. We assume it's non-zero. So i, i, i, i. And then we have that the total resistance of the circuit is equal to r1 plus r2 plus r3. So when you have resistors in series like this, the total resistance of their combined resistance is just equal to their sum. And that was just a very long\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's work through another few scenarios involving displacement velocity in time or distance rate and time. So over here we have, Ben is running at a constant velocity of three minutes per, or three meters per second to the east, three meters per second to the east. And just as a review, this is a vector quantity. They're giving us the magnitude and the direction. If they just said three write t there, but it's really a change in time. So sometimes some people would write a little triangle, a delta there, which means change in time. But that's implicitly meant when you just write over time like that. So rate or speed is equal to distance divided by time. Now if you know they're giving us in this problem, they're giving us the rate, if we think about the scalar part of it, they're giving us the take it one step at a time. So three meters per second, is equal to 720 meters. And that makes sense, at least units-wise, because time is going to get 720 divided by 3 seconds. So what is that? 720 divided by 372 divided by 3 is 24. So this is going to be 240. This part right over here is going to be 240. And it's going to be 240 seconds. That's the only unit we're left with. And on the left hand side, we just had the time. So or the formula for motion. If we flip it around, you get distances equal to rate times time. So these are all saying the same things. And then if we want to solve for time, you can multiply both sides by time and you get, 720 divided by three will give you 240. We'll give you 240. And then you have, when you take meters in the numerator and you divide by meters per second in the denominator, that's the same thing as multiplying by seconds per meter, those cancel out and you are just left with seconds here. One note I wanna give you. In the last few problems, I've been making vector quantities by saying to the east,\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. In the last video, I just, you know, at the end of the video, like I always do in an attempt to confuse you. I told you that if I had two vectors, then let me just make up some new ones just so I can draw them visually in a second or two. Let's call the first vector a, let me do a different color. This toothpaste color is getting monotonous. Let me do something that looks relaxing. So let's call it the first vector a's just saying that those are vectors. That equals, this should be an equal sign, equals, not equals, that's equals. So it's minus three plus two I,. I have to make sure I have enough space to draw the unit vectors that we've drawn. I'm going to draw the vectors that we've drawn. So that's just to show you that the axes go on forever after you draw that arrow. All right. So let's see. I go ahead and then plus 2j. So plus 2j looks like this. This is plus 2j. And if we were to add those two vectors visually, we can put them head to tails and the way we can do that, we can either shift this vector up like this and draw it up here, we can shift this vector and put its tail to this vector's head. But either way, so let's shift this one up. So if we shift it looks like this. And let's take this one and shift it over to the left so we can put its tail to this vector's head so it would be look like this. So vector b will look, and I'll do it in red, and I'll use the line tool, vector b, looks like this. And remember, all I did is I took the same vector and I just shifted it so that it can start at the head, so its tail can start at the head of the B vector, right? So I just shifted the A vector. So this is still the A vector. By moving a vector around, you haven't changed the vector. I would only change the vector if I scaled it, if I made it bigger or smaller, if I changed its orientation. And not drawing neatly, but these two points should actually be here if I were to have drawn this better. But I know this was very confusing. I had all these colors, but the whole point of it is I wanted you to show that you could visually draw vectors and then shift them around and then put them heads to tails and then get the resulting vector. That's one way to add vectors and there's still no way to analytically represent it. Or you could just write any vector as it is.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is think about how the normal force might be different in different scenarios. And since my two and a half year old son is obsessed with elevators, I thought I would focus on those. So here I've drawn four scenarios and we can imagine them almost happening in some type of a sequence. So in this first picture right over here, I'm. And let's say we do that for one second, and then we get to this screen right over here. So we had no velocity. We accelerate, oh, this is two meters per second squared. Let me make sure. It's two meters per second. Per second, this is acceleration here. So we do that for one second, and then at the J direction. So it's actually accelerating downwards now. It has to slow it down to get it back to stationary. So what I want to do is think about what would be the normal force, the force that the floor of the elevator is exerting on me in each of these situations. And we're going to assume that we gravitational field near the surface of the earth, the 9.8 meters per second squared, let me write that over here. The gravitational field near the surface of the earth is 9.8 meters per second squared, and the negative tells you it is going downwards. So you multiply this times 10 kilograms, the here, the person is, this person has no acceleration. If they have no acceleration in any direction, and we're only concerning ourselves with the vertical direction right here, that means that there must be no net force on them. This is from Newton's first law of motion. But if there's no net force on them, there must be some force that's counteracting this force, because if there was nothing else, there would to be the mass of this toddler, is going to be 10 kilograms, times the acceleration of this toddler, times 2 meters per second squared, which is equal to 20 kilograms meters per second squared, which is the same thing as 20 Newtons. 20 Newtons upwards, 20 Newtons upwards is the net accelerating upward, the normal force is now 20 Newtons higher than it was there. And that's what's allowing this toddler to accelerate. Now let's think about this situation. No acceleration, but our velocity is, but we do have velocity. So here we were stationary, here we do have velocity. And you might be tempted to think, oh, there must be, tells us there's no net force on this. So it's just like the first situation. The normal force, the force of the elevator on this toddler shoes is going to be identical to the downward force due to gravity. So the normal force here is going to be 98 Newtons, completely nets out the downward, the negative 98 Newtons. So once again this is in the J direction 98 Newtons in the J direction. So we're not fully compensating for that because we're still going to have a net negative force while this child is decelerating. And that negative net force is a negative net force of, I keep repeating it, negative 20. So we're only going to have 78, we're only going to have a 78 Newton normal force here that counteracts all but 20\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say I've got a rope. That's my rope. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the left end of the rope and I'm going to jerk it up and then back down. And we're going to talk about what happens or what possibly gets formed. So if I take it up over here, it's going to obviously take the string to the right of it up with it and the string is going to look like now? Well, this guy, he's essentially, he was, he had some momentum that got him there, but then all of that velocity will essentially go to zero because he's being tugged by the rope to the left. And now he's going to switch directions and he will have gotten here at that point. The point on the line that was here in on the, I guess on the purple period of time, it had some upward momentum. So it's just going to keep going the rope. In the next moment of time, what's it going to look like? This guy is going to be pulled up by the left hand point. He'll go back to his resting position. This guy is being pulled down right here by the part of the rope to the left of him. He's going to be pulled down. This guy is being pulled down. But this guy had some upward momentum in the time period before. He will have moved up. In the very next time period, my rope is going to actually define a wave. A wave. Because once I define it, I can start calling this a wave as opposed to a disturbance propagating down the rope. So a wave is a disturbance. A disturbance propagating through space. Propagating through space. And you might see other definitions of a wave. One of the rope, I gave a little energy to the rope. I moved it up, down, and then back again. And then after I did that, that up, down, back again is happening, successively, to every point to the right on the rope. So, you know, if I wait long enough at this point on the rope right here, it's going to move up, down, and then back again. Exactly what I did over here, it's going to happen to this point on the rope. And then later on, it's going to happen to some other future point on the rope. So that energy that I originally put in on the left-hand side of the air. So it just pushes, so let me see if I can draw this. So let's say I had some type of surface here, that just really quickly jolts, that just moves in that direction and then just comes back. So just similar to what I did here, I go up and down, but instead of doing that, it just pushes the air and then pushes back. So what's going to happen? So right after it pushes it, the air molecules that it pushes up against are going to jam together. So this area might look normal. This area will look normal, but that compression of the particles might have reached right over here. That compression of the particles might have reached right over there. And not only that, we saw that right after the compression, you usually have a area of low pressure. So if I were to really draw this wave, and actually if this membrane were to keep doing it same thing. Compression wave, because it's caused by compression. Our example of the string, this is called a transverse wave. This is called a transverse wave. Because the disturbance, the movement of the medium is going in a direction transverse to the, right there, where that's the disturbance generated from our first time that we moved this left-hand part of our string. So this is right here as a periodic wave. Periodic wave. And in the next video, we're going to talk about a lot of the properties of a periodic wave, before the sound waves hits, that's just your normal density. If we were to plot the density, it might look something like this. So over here we have very high density, over here we have very low density, over here we have very high density, and if you were to plot it, it would look a lot like that transverse wave, that transverse wave that I did with the rope at the beginning of this video. And that's why they're even grouped together, because mathematically, even though a compression wave looks very different, or you might visualize it, or conceptualize it,\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's see if we get a little bit more practice and intuition of what cross products are all about. So in the last example, we took A cross B. Let's see what happens when we take B cross A. So let me erase some of this. Let me erase, I don't want to erase all of it because it might be useful to give us an intuition to compare. So let's say Because I'm still going to take the magnitude of b times the magnitude of a times the sine of the angle between them, which was pi over six radians, and then times some unit vector n. But this is going to be the same. When I multiply scalar quantities, it doesn't matter what order I multiply them in, right? So this is still going to be 25, whatever my units might right angle of your thumb. So in this example, if this is, that's the direction of A, this is the direction of B. And we're doing B cross A. That's why B gets your index finger. The index finger gets the first term. Your middle finger gets the second term. And, I'll tell you, the cross product comes into use and to a lot of concepts that frankly we don't have a lot of real life intuition with electrons flying through a magnetic field or magnetic field through a coil. And a lot of things that, you know, in our everyday life experience, maybe if we were metal filings living in a magnetic field, our entire, well, we do live in a magnetic field, in a strong magnetic field, maybe we would get an intuition, but it's hard to have be longer than A, I just keep. So this is A and this is B. Now we could think of a little bit, we could say well this is the same thing as A sine theta times B, or we could say this is B sine theta times A. Hope I'm not continuing. All I'm saying is you can interpret this as, this could also be written as, because these are just magnitudes, right? So it doesn't matter what order you multiply them in. You couldenuse is the magnitude of A. So sine of theta is equal to this side, which I call O for opposite over the magnitude of A. So this term A sine theta is actually just the magnitude of this line right here. Another way you can let me redraw it. It doesn't matter where the vectors start from I don't care about the entire magnitude of, say, vector A in this example, I care about the magnitude of vector A that is perpendicular to vector B. And those are the two numbers that I want to multiply and then give it that direction as specified by the right If that's A, that's B. The component of B that is perpendicular to A is going to look like this. I'll draw it in a different color. It's going to be perpendicular to A and it's going to go that far.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say I have some type of a block here, and let's say this block has a mass of M. So the mass of this block is equal to M. And it's sitting on this, you could view this as an inclined plane or a ramp or some type of wedge. And we want to think about what might happen to this block. And we'll start thinking about the different forces that might keep it in place or not keep it in place in all of the rest. So the else is going to be happening here? Well, it gets a little bit confusing because you can't really say that you can do, you can't say that normal force is acting directly against this force right over here because remember, the normal force acts perpendicular to a surface. So over here the surface is not perpendicular to the force of gravity. So we have to think about it a little bit differently than we do if this was sitting on that's perpendicular because it shows a line that's perpendicular to, I guess, this bottom line, this horizontal line over there. And this blue thing over here, I'm going to call this the force, or the part of force, due to gravity, that is parallel. That is parallel. I'm just doing those two upward vertical bars, this is something that is parallel, this parallel to the surface. So this is the component of force up to 180, then that means that this one and this one need to add up to 90 degrees. Or if this is theta, this angle right over here, this angle right over here is going to be 90 minus theta. Now the other thing that you may or may not remember from geometry classes, if I have two parallel lines, if I have two parallel lines here, if I have two parallel lines, and then I have a transverse, so the Earth. So this line over here and this line over here in magenta are going to be parallel. I can even draw that. That line and that line are both parallel. When you look at it that way, you'll see that this big line over here can be viewed as a transversal. Or you could have this angle and this angle are going to be congruent. They're going to be alternate interior angles. Or this angle plus 90 minus theta must be equal to, let me write this down. I don't want to do too much in your head. So let's call it x. So x plus 90 minus theta plus this 90 degrees right over here, plus this 90 degrees needs to be equal to 180 degrees. We can subtract 180 degrees from both sides. So the magnitude, let's think about it a little bit, the magnitude of the, I'll do it over here, the magnitude of the perpendicular force due to gravity or I used to say the component of gravity that is perpendicular to the ramp, the magnitude of that vector, a lot of fancy notation, but it's really just the length of this vector right over here. So the magnitude of this over the hypotenuse, you get the component of our vector that is perpendicular to the surface of the plane is equal to the magnitude of our gravity or the force due to gravity, the magnitude of the force due to gravity times the cosine of theta. Times the cosine of theta. We'll apply this in the next video just get the component of the force due to gravity that is parallel zero, if the perpendicular four should be the same thing as the total gravitational force. And that's why it's cosine of theta, because cosine of zero right now is one, and so these would equal each other. And if this equals zero, then the parallel component of gravity should go to zero, because gravity will only be acting downwards.\", 'Physics'], [\" Last video we saw what happens when we have resistors in series. Now let's see what happens when we have resistors in parallel. Alright, let me pick a new color. New color will be magenta. There's my battery, positive, negative. There is my ideal conducting wire. Here's my ideal conducting wire. But flow. The electrons are flowing, flowing, flowing at a given rate. And then here they have a choice. Some of them can take this top path. Some of them can take this bottom path. So I think it is reasonable, and you could imagine with water pipes or anything, that the current going into the branch is equal to the current exiting the branch. Or then voltage, let me draw that, let me do it in another color in blue. So for example, the voltage anywhere along this blue that I'm filling in is going to be the same because this wire is an ideal conductor and you can almost view this blue part as an extension of the positive terminal of the battery. And very similarly, let me call this our total resistance, right? Let's say we couldn't see this and we just said, oh, that's just some total resistance, right? And that is equal to the current going through R1. This is, yeah, this is I1, this is the one right here. This is current I1. Well, what's current an r3 here, let's say that, you know, we had another device and then it was there and this r3, we would just, you know, you could use the exact same argument, you would have a plus 1 over r3. And if you had rn or, you know, 20 ohms, and let's say that this resistance is five ohms. What I want to know is what is the current through the system? Or, you know, first we'll have to figure out what equal to four ohms. So we could redraw this crazy circuit as this. I'll try to draw it small down here. We could redraw this where this resistance is four ohms and this is 16 volts. Right? We could say that this whole thing combined is really just a resistor divided by 20 ohms. So let's call this I1. So I1 is equal to 16 volts divided by 20 ohms, which is equal to what? 4 5ths. So it equals 4 5ths of an ampere, or 0.8 amperes, right? And similarly, what is the amount of current flowing through here? I2. Let me do this in a different color.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say we observe some object, let's say for the sake of argument it's happening in space, and it's traveling in a circular path with the magnitude of its velocity being constant. And I want to be very clear here because the magnitude, so let me draw its velocity vector. So that is the length of this arrow is the magnitude of its velocity, but I want to be clear. In order for it to be traveling in a circular path, the direction of its velocity needs to be changing. So at this time, the velocity vector might look like that. After a few direction of the velocity would change. If there were no force acting on this object, it would just continue going on in the direction it was going. It wouldn't curve. It wouldn't turn. The direction of its velocity wasn't changing. So let's think about what the direction of that force would have to be. And to do that, I'm going to, between this purple time right over here and this, I guess this magenta time and this purple time, what was the change in velocity? Well, we can look at that purely from these vectors right here in time, and obviously we're just sampling points, it's continuously moving, and the change in velocity is actually continuously changing, but hopefully you're going to see a pattern here. So between those two points in time, this right here is our change in velocity, and is causing the change in velocity. So the force must be acting in the same direction as this change in velocity. So in order to make this object go in this circular path, there must be some force acting on this object would actually have to be center, or it would have to be towards the center. And the whole reason why I drew these vectors and then translated them over here and then drew these change in velocity vectors is to show you that the change in velocity is actually towards the center of this body. Now, or towards the center of this circle. Another example that you are probably somewhat familiar with, or at least have heard about, is if you have something in orbit around a planet. So let's say that this is Earth right here, this is Earth right that we're looking at the top of a car, that's its tires. We're looking at the top of a car. And when you see a car going at a constant speed, so on this pedometer it might just say whatever, 60 miles an hour or 40 miles an hour, whatever the constant speed, but it's traveling in a circle. It's traveling in a circle. So what is keeping? What is the centripetal force in that example? There's no obvious stream.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is answer an age-old question, or at least an interesting question to me. And the question is, let's say I have a ledge here, I have a ledge or a cliff, or maybe this is a building of some kind, and let's say it has height h. So let's say it has a height of h right over here. And what I'm curious about is want to do it. So let's just think about the problem. And just so you know, some of you might say, wait, that's not realistic. But this actually would be realistic for a small age. If you were to jump off of the roof of a one-story building, air resistance will not be a major component in determining your speed. If it was to be a much larger building, then all of a sudden it matters. And I don't recommend you do any of these things. Those are all very dangerous things, much better to do it with a rock. So that's actually the example we're going to be a negative number right over there. And we know that the acceleration of gravity for an object in free fall near the surface of the earth, we know and we're going to assume that it's constant. So our constant acceleration is going to be negative 9.8 meters per second squared. So what we're going to do is given an h and given that their initial velocity is zero and that our acceleration is negative 9. time, or the amount of elapsed time that goes by, this is our change in velocity. So elapsed time is the same thing, all right over here, is our change in velocity divided by our acceleration. And just to make sure you understand this, it just comes straight from the idea that acceleration, or let me write it this we know that the initial velocity is zero here. So our change in velocity is the same thing as our final velocity. So once again this will be times, instead of writing change in velocity here we can just write our final velocity. Because we're starting at zero, initial velocity is zero. So times our final velocity divided by our'll be equal to our final velocity squared. Final velocity times final velocity. And so we can just solve for final velocity here. So we know our acceleration is negative to be negative h. And negative h meters. So this is the variable. And this is the shorthand for meters. So when you multiply these two things out, lucky for us, these negatives cancel out the square root of 19.6 h. And you can even take the square root of the meter squared per second squared, treat them almost like variables, even though they're units. And then outside of the radical sign, you will get a meters per second. And the thing I want to be careful here is if we just take the principal root here, the principal root here is the positive square root. But we know that our velocity is going to be downwards here because that is our convention. So we want to take the square root of that. So it's going to be almost 10. So the square root of 98. It gives us 9.9, roughly 9.9 and we want the negative square root of that. So in that situation when the height is 5 meters, so if you jump off of a one story commercial building, you're going right at the bottom or if you throw a rock out at right at the bottom right before it hits the ground, it will have a velocity of negative 9.9 meters.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. We'll now do another tension problem. This one is just a slight increment harder than the previous one, just because we have to take out slightly more sophisticated algebra tools than we did in the last one, but it's not really any harder. But you should actually see this type of problem, because you'll probably see it on an exam. So let's figure out the tension in the wire. So first of all, we know that this point right here isn't moving. So the tension in this little small wire right here is easy. It's trivial. It's the force of the wire along the same line. So let's say that this is the tension vector of T1. If that's the tension vector, its X component will be this. Let me see how good I can draw this. That's intended to be a straight line, but that would be its X component. And its X component, let's see, this is 30 degrees. This is 30 degrees right here. And hopefully this is a bit second? We know that when you, that their net force is zero, or that you also know that the magnitude of these two vectors should cancel each other out, or that they're equal. I mean, they're pulling in opposite directions. videos, hopefully I'm not creating too many gaps and this is relatively easy to follow. So we have the square root of 3 times T1 minus 1 half T2 is equal to zero. So that gives us an equation, one equation with two unknowns, so it doesn't sine of 60 degrees, sine of 60. You could review your trigonometry in your circuit. That tends to be frankly, I think do it in this color so that you know that it's the different equation. So if you multiply square root of 3 over 2 times 2, I'm just doing this to get rid of the 2's and the denomin equation. So you can also view it as multiplying it by negative one and then adding the two. So when you subtract this from this, these two terms cancel out, because they're the same. And so then you're left with minus t2 from here, minus the tension in the first wire is equal to five newtons. So this is pulling with the force of, or tension of five newtons or force, and this is pulling the second wire with the tension of five squares of three newtons. So this, this wire right here is actually doing more of the pulling. It's actually more of the force of gravity is ending up on this wire.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's do a little compare and contrast between the dot product and the cross product. So let me just make two vectors. Just let me visually draw them and maybe if we have time we'll actually figure out, now that's too thin. We'll actually figure out some dot and cross products with real vectors. And let me make another one. I always make a relatively acute cross product. What is A cross B? Well, first of all, that does not equal B cross A. It's actually equals the opposite direction where you could view it as the negative of B cross A. Because the vector that you end up with ends up flipped, whichever order you do it in. But A cross B, A and B. And then when you might say, okay, A and B the way I drew them, they're both sitting in the plane of this video screen or your video screen. So in order for something to be perpendicular to both of these, it either has to pop out of the screen or pop into the screen, right? And when you learn about the cross product, I said, you know, there's two ways of, you know, to show a vector popping out of the screen, it looks like that because that's the tip of an arrow. And to show other two fingers just do what they need to do. I like to just bend them out of the way. I'm trying my best to draw. So they just curl around my hand. And then what direction is my thumb in? My thumb, well, actually I drew it in the wrong angle. I drew it in my thumb is actually going in this direction, right, into the page. This is the top of my hand. These are like my veins, right? Or if I actually drew it'll review it because I think it all fits together when you see them with each other. Let me do some erase. No, that's not what I wanted to do. I can erase this way. Okay. So first let's study with AB cosine of theta. So if you watch the dot product video, B cosine theta, if you drop a line perpendicular to A, this is a right angle. B cosine theta, adjacent over hypotenuse is equal to cosine theta. So it would be the projection of B going in the same direction as A. So it would be this magnitude. So this vector right here is A cosine theta, the magnitude of A cosine theta. And they're actually the same number. If you take how much of B goes in the direction of A and multiply that with the magnitude's the direction of the force perpendicular to another vector. And so that's where the cross product comes in useful. Anyway, hopefully that gave you a little intuition. And you could have done it the other way. You could have written this\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's see if we can use what we know about springs now to get a little intuition about how the spring moves over time and hopefully we'll learn a little bit about a harmonic motion. We'll actually even step into the world of differential equations a little bit and don't get daunted when we get there or just close your eyes when it happens. Anyway, so I've drawn a spring like I've done in the last couple of videos and zero, this point in the function of time. That's going to be our goal on this video in probably the next few. So let's just get an intuition for what's happening here. So let me try to graph x as a function of time. So time is the independent variable, and minus A. So at time t equals zero, where is it? Well, it's at A, so this is where the graph is. Right? And let's actually, let's do something interesting. Let's say, let's define the period. So the period I'll do with a capital T. Let's say the period is how long it takes for this mass to go from this What's going to be the x position? What? t over 2, the block is going to be here. It will have compressed all the way over here. So t over 2 would have been here. And then at the points in between, it will be at x equals 0. Right? It will be there and there. Hopefully that makes sense. So now we know these points, but let's think about what the actual function keep going here and then you'll have a point here. So what's happening? When you start off, you're going very slow. Your change of x is very slow. And then you start accelerating. And then once you get to this point right here, you start decelerating. You start decelerating. Until at this point, your velocity is almost, your velocity is exactly zero. So your rate of change or your slope is equal to one, right? So when t equals zero, this function is equal to a. So this function probably looks something like a cos I'll actually write the position as a function of t, just so you remember. We're so used to x being the independent variable that if I didn't write that function of t, it might get confusing. You're like, oh, I thought x is just the rate of change of velocity, right? So it would be taking the derivative of this or another way of viewing it. It's like taking the second derivative of the position function, right? So in this situation, acceleration is equal to, we could write it as, you know, I'm just showing you all the different notations, x prime prime of t, second derivative of t of x with respect to x.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say you and I are playing a game where we're trying to figure out how high a ball is being thrown in the air or how fast that we're throwing that ball in the air. And what we do is one of us has a ball and the other one has a stopwatch over here. So this is my best attempt. It looks more like a cat than a stopwatch, but I think you get the idea. And what we do is one of us throws the ball and the other one times how long the ball is in the air. And then what we do is we're going to use's hand all the way to its peak height and in the next two seconds it took that same amount of time to go back down to the ground which makes sense. Whatever the initial velocity is it takes half the time to go to you're going from your initial velocity to being stationary at the top, right when the ball is stationary and then starts getting increasing velocity in the downward direction. So it takes 2.5 seconds to go from some initial velocity to 0 seconds. So we do know what the acceleration of gravity time. We're just talking about the first half of the ball's time in the air. So our change in time is 2.5 seconds. So what is our change in velocity, which is also the same thing as the negative of our initial velocity? Get the calculator out. version of that and then that gives you that gives you your initial velocity. So your initial velocity here is literally 24.5 meters per second and since it's a positive quantity it is upwards in this example. So that's my initial velocity. So we already figured out part of this game. The initial velocity that I threw at upwards that? That's going to be 24.5 meters per second. Plus, what's our final velocity? In this situation, remember, we're just going over the first 2.5 seconds. So our final velocity is once again, 0 meters per second. We're just talking about when we get to this point right over here. So our final velocity is just 0 meters per second, and we're just going to divide that by 2.625 meters. The seconds cancel out, meters. So someone, this is actually a ton, this is roughly, give or take, about 90 feet thrown in the air. So this would be like a nine story building and I frankly do not have the arm for that. But if someone is able to throw the ball for five seconds of the air,\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. In the last video, I told you that that pressure times volume is a constant that if you increase the pressure or if you increase the volume, you're going to decrease the pressure and hopefully you got an intuitive sense why or likewise, if you squeezed the balloon or the box and there were no openings there, then the pressure within the box would increase. So with that said, let should immediately have an intuition that what happens when you squeeze the balloon? It becomes harder to do it. Sorry, I just had some peanuts. I should have had some water with it. My throat's very dry. But anyway, I'll try to soldier through this video. So what's going to be the new pressure? Well, it's same units on the same side, because this is the equivalence, is not equal, we're not saying it has to equal to some necessary absolute number. For example, we don't know exactly what this K is, although we could figure it out right now. As long as you're using one unit for pressure on this side and one unit for volume on this side, you just have to use the So when I decreased the volume by roughly 60% is how much I decreased the volume, I have the pressure actually increased by 2.5. So that gels with what we talked about before. Now I think you have the sense, even though they're the same temperature, they're both pretty warm, let's say this was 100 degrees Celsius, so they're both boiling, that the barrel, because there's more of it, it's going to be equal to the number of molecules times the temperature. And you know, this is just a constant. So, you know, times 1 over k, but 1 over k, we don't even know what this is. So, we could say that's still a constant. So, the kinetic energy of the system is going to be equal to some constant times the number of particles times temperature, right? And we don't know what this is, and we're going to figure constants, we'll figure out this exact constant later. But we could say that pressure times volume is proportional to the number of molecules we have times temperature, and we said kind of temperature is, we can kind of view it as energy per molecule. Or another way we could say it, if this constant is constant the walls more. So if they bounce against the walls more, the pressure is going to go up. Assuming volume stays flat. Another way you could think about it, let's say the temperature goes up and I increase and let's say the pressure stays\", 'Physics'], [\" We now know how long the object is going to be in the air, so we're ready to figure out how far it's going to travel. So we can just go back to kind of the core formula and all of really kinematics, all of kind of projectile motion or mechanical physical problems, and that distance is equal to rate times time. Distance is equal to rate times time. Now we're talking about the horizontal distance. So our distance is going to be equals sine theta over g. So the total distance we're going to travel pretty straightforward. Rate times time is just the product of these two things. And we could put all of the constants out front. So it's a little bit clearer that it's a function of theta. So we can write that the distance traveled. Let me do that same green. The distance traveled as a\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video where we launched something at an angle, we figured out the horizontal and the vertical components of that launch velocity. And we use a vertical component to figure out how long that thing is in the air. And then we use that time to figure out how far it will travel given a constant horizontal velocity. What I want to do in this video is to redo part of that problem. And I want to redo the part to figure out how long this object stays in the air. And our vertical velocity, our velocity in the y direction is five meters per second. And also as a reminder, our convention, when we're dealing with vectors in one dimension, and this is essentially in one dimension now, since we know it's in the y direction, is positive means up, negative means down when we're going to multiply that times change in time. Times change in time. Now what is our final velocity going to be? Our final velocity, I'll write it over here. that simplifies to two VIs, two times our initial velocities. And so this expression right here simplifies to two times VI divided by two is our initial velocity, our initial velocity, and then we have, well, I'll just do it all here, and then I'll multiply times the you have a delta, t times a delta, remember delta just means change in time. This triangle just means change in time. So change in time times change in time is change in time squared. Change that. So we have the displacement is going to be zero. So zero is equal to our initial velocity is five meters per second upwards..2 is 4.9, 4.9. And if you factor out a delta t out of delta t squared, you're left with another delta t. So there's two solutions here. There's two ways to get, there's two delta t's that'll give us zero. Either this delta t is equal to zero. So either delta t is equal to zero. That's just our starting point. So that's not the time that we're interested in when no time has passed\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. Now let's do some more mechanical advantage problems and in this video we'll focus on pulleys which is another form of a simple machine. And we've done some pulley problems in the past but now we'll actually understand what the mechanical advantage inherent in these machines are. So let's start with a very simple pulley. So this is a ceiling up here. I don't know what they call that part of the pulley. I should total distance that the object you're trying to move travels? And if you know the distance that it travels versus the distance that you have to pull, you know the mechanical advantage. So in this situation, if I were to hold the rope at that point, and if I were to pull it down, I don't know, 10 feet or some arbitrary distance, what happens over here? Well, this weight is going to move up exactly the some point maybe I can't reach up here so it's nice for me to pull down here where I can reach and the object will keep going up like in a flagpole or something like that. So this could still be useful even though its mechanical advantage is only one. So yourself, if I were to take a point on this rope, and if I were to pull it, let's say I were to pull it two feet down, so let's say I take this point and I move it two feet down. What essentially happens to the rope? Well, every point on the rope is going And if this is getting one foot shorter and this is one getting one foot shorter, it makes sense that this whole thing is getting two feet shorter. But the important thing to realize if each of these are getting a foot shorter, that this weight is only moving up one foot. So when I pull with two feet, if I pull the rope down two feet here, this weight only moves up one foot. So what is the work that I'm doing? Well, the work in is the same as the workout.'t know, times the distance, which is 2 meters, is equal to 10 joules. So divide both sides by 2. So the force that I pull down with is 5 newtons. So I pull down 5 newtons for 2 meters and it pulls up a 10 newton weight for 1 meter. 4 times distance is equal to 4 times distance. So what was the input force? The input force is equal to 5 newtons and call this whatever distance this is, let's call this d. What is this distance going to be? Well, it's going to be d sine of 30, and we know that the sine of 30 degrees, hopefully by this point, is 1 half. So this is sorry, this isn't five joules. It's 10 times one half times the distance. It's five D joules, right? This isn't some kind of unit. It's 10 joules, it's 10 units times the distance that we're up in.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say we have a magnetic field that's coming out of the right side of the screen and it's not just along the screen, it's actually, you know, it's three-dimensional. So it's going above the screen below, but the direction of the magnetic field is from the right to the left. Let me just draw that. And I'm not going to draw a bunch of the field vector arrows because that'll just take up a lot of valuable space on our... So is coming out of this end. It's coming into this end. So let's say that this loop of, it could be a paper clip or anything, let's say that it can rotate and that's important. What's going to happen? Well, my magnetic field is coming in this direction. The current is going down here, up here. What's going to be the net force of the current or in the direction of L, because that's the first term in the cross-product, so that's the index finger. So my index finger goes down, because that's the direction of the current. And then my middle finger, and remember, you have to do this with the right hand. If you do it the left hand, you're going to get the opposite result. And now my middle finger is going to go in the direction of the field. So let me point my middle finger. My middle finger is going to go in this orangey brown color. The force vector on this segment of the wire is going to be going down. Now, what about this segment of the wire? Well, think about it. This segment of the wire, the L vector, this L vector, it's going, well, it's parallel to the magnetic field just in the opposite direction. And so when you take the cross product, if you finger will go in the direction of the field. So your middle finger is going to look something like that. And then your other two fingers are going to be like that. And where's your thumb going to do? And this has to be your right hand to work. Your thumb is going to point straight up. This is like the heel of your thumb. And your thumb is going to, I don't know if that's a good drawing of a. So it will actually exert all of that force. That force times this distance will be the torque applied on this side. And then likewise, there's a torque in the, it's really the same sign in the same direction, current is going in that direction there, going in that direction there. So using the same right hand rule on this side of the wire, the magnetic field is going to be exerting a net downward force, but the torque is actually going to be less, right? Because our actual, our moment arm distance is going to be like up directly out of the page, directly out of the page, but that's not completely perpendicular to the moment arm. So the component that is perpendicular, that's actually creating rotational torque, that's going to be a little less. And then you can imagine that all the way to the point, the coil is going to keep rotating with smaller torque. And at some point, you'll be looking at it head on. So I could just draw it like a straight line.\", 'Physics'], [\" Just want to follow up on the last video where we threw balls in the air and saw how long they stayed up in the air and we used that to figure out how fast we initially threw the ball and how high they went in the air. And in the last video we did it with specific numbers. In this video I just want to see if we can derive some interesting formulas so we can do the computations really fast in our brains while we're playing this game out on some type of a field and we don't necessarily have any paper around. So let's say that the if we just consider half of the time? Well, it's the time it's 0. So it's going to be 0 minus our initial velocity. That's our change in velocity. This is our change in velocity. The acceleration of gravity, not negative 9.9 meters per second squared times the total time that we are in the air. Or you could say it's going to be 9.8 meters per second squared times half of the time that we're in the air. Either of those would get you the same calculation. So let's figure out peak point right over here. That's from two videos ago. That peak point right over there. So our average velocity is just going to be, our average velocity is just going to be this stuff divided by two. So it's going to be 4.9 divided by 4. 4.9 divided by 4 is, was it, it's 1.21.225. I think, let me just get the calculator out. I want to do that in my head. Get this far to make a careless mistake. 4.9 divided by 4 is 1.225. So our maximum displacement is going to be 1.225.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. We just finished this problem with the pulleys and the incline plane. I just wanted to do one final thing on this problem just because I think it's interesting. Then we can move on to what seems like a pretty fun problem. The last thing I want to figure out is we figured out this 20 kilo, actually the whole system will accelerate up and to the right at 4.13 meters per second squared. The second part of this question is what on this object? On just this object. Well, the net force is, and you can ignore what I said before about the net force So minus 113 newtons downwards, which is the same thing as 113 newtons upwards. And so that is the tension in the rope. My destiny was really to be a great artist. This is my hand and I'm holding a pie and I'm looking to smash this pie into this individual's face. I actually was a... I was my... the newspaper cartoonist in high school, so I have some minor... accelerate it? Let's see what's happening. So we have the force of gravity pulling down. So let's say that the mass of the pie is m. m equals mass. So what is the force of gravity pulling down on the pie? Well, the force of gravity is just equal to m times 9.8. The force of friction is.8, what is the force that I have to apply? Well, the force I have to apply in this case is going to be the normal force, right? That's normal to the bottom of the pi, right? I am like the, my hand is now like the surface of the ramp. So this is the normal force. And we know that the force of friction is have to apply is 12.25 times the mass. So that's the force I am applying. It's times the mass. We don't know the mass of the pie. So how fast am I accelerating the pie? Well, force is equal to mass times acceleration. This is the force, 12.25 m. That's the force is equal to the mass of the pie.\", 'Physics'], [\" I will now introduce you to the concept of tension. So tension is really just the force that exists either within or applied by a string or a wire when it's usually lifting something or pulling on something. So let's say I had a weight, let's say I have a weight here. And let is also another way to think about it, is that's also the force that's within the wire. And that is going to exactly offset the force of gravity on this weight. And that's what keeps this point right here. That's what keeps this point right here stationary and keeps it from accelerating. So that's pretty straightforward. Tension, it's attached to the ceiling up here. That's the ceiling now. And let's see, this is the wall. And let's say there's another string right here attached to the wall. So my question to you is, what is the tension in these two strings? So let's call this T1, T1, The second wire is just pulling to the left. It has no y component. It's not lifting up at all. So it's just pulling to the left. So all of the upward lifting, all of that's going to occur from this first wire, from T1. So we know that theonometry problems right? And so we have we could actually now visually see that this is t sub 1 x and this t sub 1 sub y. Oh and I forgot to give you an important problem that you would that you needed to know before solving it is that the angle and the hypotenuse? So opposite or hypotenuse? So that we know the sign, let me switch to the sign of 30 degrees is equal to T1 sub y over the tension in the string little confusing to you. We just said this point is stationary. It's not moving up or down. It's not accelerating up or down. And so we know that there is a downward force of 100 newtons, so there must be an upward force that's being provided by these two wires. This wire is providing no upward force. So all of the upward force must be the y direction is the x component of the first wire's tension. So it's this. So T2 is equal to the x component of the first wire's tension. And what's the x component? Well, it's going to be the tension in the first wire, 200 Newtons, times the cosine of 30 degrees.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's talk a little bit about what I find to be, one of the more mysterious forces of the universe. Actually, I find all of the forces of the universe to be fairly mysterious. So let's talk a little bit about charge. We've all heard of charge. You know, charge the battery. This particle has charge. But when you really think about it, all charge is a property of particles and objects, just like mass. I mean, if you think about it, mass is just a property. And to some degree, it seems a little bit more real than charge because our brains are wired to, in some way, comprehend what mass is. But we're probably more comprehending weight and volume more than mass. But we can think more about that at another the unit of charge is called the Coulomb. It's named after a scientist in the late 1700s who played around a lot with charge. You can look up more about him on Wikipedia. But it's called the Coulomb. And the Coulomb, there's a bunch of definitions. But I like to think of it in terms a negative charge. And the fundamental unit of charge, as far as we are concerned right now before we start talking about quarks and other potentially subatomic particles, is the charge in an electron or proton. And they have the exact same charge, and that elementary charge is denoted by E. And to be frank, I'm not sure whether E stands for elementary or E stands it is. But a Coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to the 18th ease. Or you could say it's 6.24 times 10 to the 18th times the charge on an electron. Actually, times the charge on a proton. And then of course, in terms of magnitude. Because if I just say Coulomb, I'm not really giving a direction. right? Like charges repel, so both of these are positive, they're going to repel each other. And unlike charges, if this is negative, this is positive, they're going to attract each other, right? So by definition, if they are moving each other, these two particles are going to the gravitational constant times m1 times m2 divided by the distance between them squared. So so far the two forces that we've covered gravity and now we're covering electric I think it's 6. I always forget what that constant is. It is 9 times 10 to the ninth. So okay, we have a particle here that has a positive charge of, let's call it, I don't know, plus, let me think of a good number, I don't know, plus five times 10 to the minus two, I just rewrote that, although you probably can't see it, divided by the distance squared, so 0.5 squared. We just plugged into this formula. So that equals, let me see, so nine times 0.5 times 10, I'm just gonna do the 10 separately, so that's times minus 10, so it's minus, a negative number. So what does that mean? Well, we know that unlike particles attract, right? Almost by definition. And in this case, we had a positive and a negative. So when we have a negative, when we end up with a negative force, when we use Coulomb's law, that means that the force will draw the two particles to each other along the shortest distance between them. I mean, it's not like it's not going to make them go in a curve. It kind of makes sense. If we had a positive there, that that means that the force\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say we were to take a little excursion to the moon. And so here we are sitting on the surface of the moon. That's the surface of the moon right there. And with us to excursion to the moon, we brought two things. We brought ourself a concrete brick. So that's my brick right over there. first temptation would say, well, let's just use the law, the universal law of gravity. So what is the force of the center of the feather and the center of the moon squared. That's the distance and then we squared. So if you look at both of these expressions, they both have this quantity right over here. G times the mass of the moon divided by the distance between this height and the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance between the distance of the feather, the force on the feather is equal to all of this business. So that's the g sub m is equal to g sub m times the mass of the feather times the mass of the feather. So now assuming that the mass of the brick is much this in a neutral color. We know that force is equal to mass times acceleration. So if we want to figure out the acceleration of the brick, or we could write it the other way, the acceleration, if we acceleration on the brick on the moon, or the acceleration that the brick will experience, is the same thing as that gravitational field expression. It is g sub m. This is how quickly it would accelerate on the moon. Now let's do the same thing for the feather. I think you see where this is going. The acceleration of the feather, the acceleration of the feather same acceleration as something with a smaller mass. So any mass at the same level on the surface of the moon would experience the same acceleration. So now the quite natural question is, wait, Sal, if that's true on the moon, it should also be true on Earth. And it would be true on Earth. If you did this exact same experiment and you evacuated all the air from the room so that you didn't have air resistance and So the real difference between how things fall on earth, if you had no air, they would all fall at the exact same rate. It's only because of air that they fall at different rates. And the air does two things. For constant pressure, so if you have two objects that have the same shape, the object that is heavier, that has more weight, will fall faster because it'll overcome, it'll be able to provide more net force against the air.\", 'Physics'], [\" In this video, we're going to study the electric field created by an infinite, uniformly charged plate. And why are we going to do that? Well, one, because we'll learn that the electric field is constant, which is neat by itself. And then that's kind of an important thing to realize later when we talk about parallel charged plates and capacitors, because our physics books tell them that the field is constant, but they never really prove it. So we will prove it here. And the basis of all of that So once again, this is my infant. So it goes off in every direction and it even comes out of the video. This is a side view. And let's say I have a point charge up here, Q. Point charge Q. So let's think a little bit about if I have a point, let's say I have an area here on my plate, let's think a little bit of intuition. So if this is a positive test charge and if this plate is positively charged, the force from just this area on the charge is going to be radially outward from this area. So it's going to be, let me do it in another color because I don't want to, it's going to go in that direction, right? But since this is an infinite plate in every direction, there's going to be another point on this plate that's essentially on the other side, this point's x component effect will cancel it out, right? You can always find another point on the plate that's symmetrically opposite whose x component of electrostatic force will cancel out with the first one. So given that, that's just a long winded way of saying that the net force on this point charge will only be upwards, right? I think it should, if we knew this angle, the y component or the upwards component is going to be the electric field times cosine of theta, right? Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. So hypotenuse times cosine of theta is equal to the adjacent. So if we wanted the vertical or the y component of the electric field, we would just multiply the magnitude of the electric field from this point times cosine of theta, which equals the electric field, times the adjacent times height over the hypotenuse, over the square root of h squared plus r squared. Fair enough. So now let's draw a ring. Because all of these points are going to be the same distance from our test charge, right? They all are exactly like this one point that I drew here. You could almost view that this is a cross section of this ring that I'm drawing. So let's figure out what the y component of the electric force from this ring is on our point charge. So to do that, we just have to figure out the area of the ring, and so what's its charge going to be? It's area times the charge density, so times sigma. That is the charge of the ring. And then what is the electric field generated by the ring at this point here where our test charges? Well, per test charge. So if we divide both sides by q, we learn that the electric field of k-h, k-h, and then the charge in the ring, which we solved up here. So that's two pi sigma r, two pi sigma r, make sure I don't lose anything, two pi sigma r, dr.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's figure out how long this object is going to be in the air. Given that it's a vertical velocity, or the magnitude of the vertical velocity is s sine of theta. So it's speed in the vertical direction is s sine of theta. So how long is it going to be in the air? Well, if I told you that something is going upwards at 10 meters per second, and gravity is decelerating to having 10 meters per second again. So in this case, it'll take the time in the air, we could say time sub air, I guess, is going to be equal to this 10 meters per second, your velocity, 10 meters per second, divided by the acceleration, divided by this 10 meters per amount of time it's gonna take you to go from this point to that point, to have some vertical velocity and then slow down to zero, and it's gonna take the exact same amount of time for you to speed back up by gravity and get to your original speed, we're assuming no air resistance, so this is kind of a pure problem. So this is the time up, the time down is going to be the same thing, so we can multiply that by two. Now, we already know what the vertical component for our problem is, it is s sine of theta\", 'Physics'], [\" Now that we know the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at 400 kilometers above the surface of the Earth where the space station might hang out, what I want to do in this video is think about how fast does the space station need to be moving in order to keep missing the Earth as it's falling or the magnitude of our acceleration times the radius. And so let's get our calculator out and you can verify that the units work out. This is meters per second squared times meters, which gives us meters squared per second squared. Take the square root of that, you So the units don't do anything strange. And then we get a drum roll for how fast. And this is going to be in meters per second. We already thought about how the units will work out. We get 7,670, I could say 71, but actually I'm just going to stick to three significant digits. 7,670 meters per second. So let's do that. So we get, so that was our previous answer. We multiply by 3600, multiply by 3600 and then divide by 1000. So we really could have just multiplied by 3.6 and then we get 27 100% complete vacuum, but almost complete vacuum. So it has pretty much no air resistance, negligible air resistance to have to deal with. So we know from Newton's laws, an object in motion tends to stay in motion. So once this thing gets going, it doesn't have air to slow it down. It'll keep staying in that, it'll keep staying that speed. In fact, if it did not\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. I'm not going to introduce you to the concepts of work and energy. And these are two words that are, I'm sure you use in your everyday life already and you have some notion of what they mean, but maybe just not in the physics context, although they're not completely unrelated. So work, and you know what work is, work is when you do something, you go to work, you make a living. And physics, work is, and I'm going to use a lot of words and do work. So they kind of use each other to define each other, ability to do work. Which is frankly as good of a definition as I could find. And so with just the words, these kind of don't give you much information. So what I'm going to do is move on to the meters. And that it would equal 70, 10 times seven, Newton meters. So Newton meters is one, I guess, way of describing work. And this is also defined as one joule. And I'll do another presentation on all of the things that joule did, but joule is a distance of, I think you can guess what the distance I'm going to apply it is, for a distance of D. So I'm pushing on this block with a force of F for a distance of D. And what I want to figure out is, well, we know what the work is, I mean by definition, who final velocity squared is equal to the initial velocity squared plus two times the acceleration times the distance. And we prove this back then, so I won't redo it now. But in this situation in what we did just now. Do you see something that looks a little bit like work? Well, sure. You have this force times distance expression right here. Force times distance right here. So let's write another equation. If we know the given amount of velocity something has, if we can figure out how much work needed to be put squared over 2, just divided both sides by 2. And of course, the unit here is joules. So this is interesting. Now, if I know the velocity of an object, I can figure out using this formula, which hopefully wasn't too complicated to derive, I can figure out how much work was imputed into that object to get it to that velocity. And this, by definition, is called kinetic energy.\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video we saw that if we have two currents or two wires carrying current and the current is going in the same direction, then they'll attract each other. Now what would happen before we break into the numbers? What would happen if the two currents are going in opposite directions? Would they attract or repel each other? And you could probably guess that. But let's go through the exercise. Because I realized the last time I did it, I got a little bit messy and I'll do a little bit cleaner. I don't have to draw as many magnetic by current one on current two, that's just the convention I'm using, you wouldn't always put the one first, is equal to current two times some length, let's call that length two along the wire, this is going to be a vector because it's a magnitude of length and a direction, and it goes in the same of the index finger. Your middle finger is going to go in the direction of the field. So it's going to be pointing downwards, right? Because the field is going into the page, on this side of this wire. And your other hand is going to do what they will. And then your thumb is going to go in the direction of the net force. So your thumb is going to go like that. So there you have it. This is the top of your hand't know, let's say it's small, let's try to get a respectable number. Let's say that they're one millimeter apart, one millimeter, but we want everything in kind of our standard units so that permeability of a vacuum. So it's equal to that constant, the permeability of a vacuum, times I2, just a magnitude. And remember, we figure out the direction by wrapping our hand around it. We'll do that in a second. Divided by 2 pi times the radius. So 2 pi radius. So let me just, we can just put it in the, so the magnitude of the magnetic field there, created by current two, is equal to six times ten to the minus four Teslas. Now what's the direction of that magnetic field? So here we use our wraparound rule. Take your right hand, wrap it around the wire in the direction of the current, and then you'll get the shape of the magnetic field. So if I take my right hand, my thumb goes in the shape of the current, my hand is going to net force on this, on y or 1? So the net force on y or 1, so we could say caused by y or 2 on y or 1, is equal to the current in y or 1, so that's 2 amperes, times the vector, times the magnitude of the magnetic field, that's six times 10 to the minus four Teslas. And then when you take the cross product, you take the sine of the theta between these two vectors, right? But they're perpendicular. The magnetic field is going into the page while the direction vector\", 'Physics'], [\" I've been requested to do a video on the cross product and it was a special circumstances because I was at the point on the physics playlist where I had to teach magnetism anyway, so this is as good a time as any to introduce the notion of the cross product. So what's the cross product? Well, we've know about vector addition, vector subtraction, but what happens when you multiply vectors? And there's actually two ways to do it with the dot product or the cross between them, the smallest angle between them. And now this is the kicker. And this quantity is not going to be just a scalar quantity, it's not just going to have magnitude. It actually has direction. And that direction we specify by the vector n, the unit vector lines, but it doesn't hurt too. I don't have to draw a needle. Oh, that was unusually, I thought I was using the line tool. Okay, here we go. Let's say that that is vector A. And we want to take the cross product of them. But anyway, this is a 30 degree angle. So what will be A cross B? A cross B is going to equal the magnitude of A, so the length of this vector, so it's going to be equal to 5, times can something be perpendicular to both of these? It seems like I can't draw one. Well that's because right here where I drew A and B I'm operating in two dimensions. But a vector that's going out of the page. So we know that N is perpendicular to both A and B. This is pushing the abilities of my art skills. That's my right hand. My thumb is going to be coming down. That is my right hand that I drew. This is my index finger that. Let me draw in the same color as a. A could look something like that, and then b would look something like that. I'm trying to draw a three dimensional figure on two dimensions. It might look a little different. But I think you get the point here. I drew a and b on the plane. Here I have perspective where I was able to draw n going down. But this is the definition of a cross product. Now, I'm going to leave it there just because for some reason YouTube hasn't been letting me go over the limit as much.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. So let's do a potential energy with problem with a compressed spring. So let's make this an interesting problem. So let's say I have a loop-de-loop. A loop-de-loop made out of ice, and I made out of ice so that we don't have friction. So let me draw my loop-de-loop. Loop-de-loop. There's the loop. There's the d-loop. All right. And let's say this loop-de- different if we were on another planet. And my question to you is how much do we have to compress the spring? So, you know, let's say that the spring's natural state was here, right? If we didn't push on it and now it's here. So what is this distance? How much do I have to compress this spring? In order for when I let go of the spring, the's using energy, potential and kinetic energy. And what we learned when we learned about potential and kinetic energy is that the total energy in the system doesn't change. It just gets converted from one form to another. So it goes from potential energy to kinetic energy or, you know, or to heat. And we assume that there's no heat because there's no friction. So let's do this problem. So what we want to know is how much do I have to compress this in order to not fall down. So it's going to have some velocity, V is going tangential to the loop-de-loop. And it also is going to have some potential energy still. And where is it potential energy coming from? Well, it's going to come because it's up in the air. It's above the surface of the loop-de-loop. So it's going to have some gravitational potential energy. Right? So at this energy final is going to be mass times gravity times the height, which also stands for mass general hospital. Anyway, you can tell my wife's a doctor. So my brain just, I don't know.'s two times G. So the kinetic energy final is equal to 2G, and G is normally kilogram meters per second squared, but now it's energy, right? So it's going to be in joules, that it's a multiple of 9.8 just for you to think about. So what do we have here? All these numbers work out well. So let's divide both sides by 10 and you get x squared is equal to g, which is 9.8. So the x is going to be equal to the square root of g, which is going to be equal to what? Let's see. If I take 9.8 and take the square root of it, it's like 3.13. So x is 3.13.\", 'Physics'], [\" So just a quick review of what we were doing in the last video. We had this oddly shaped pipe and you know I had this, the fluid coming in had an input velocity V1, the pressure on the left hand side pushing to the right is P1 and its velocity, I already said velocity in the area, this hole is A1 and what we, and everything has you know the same variables with the 2 on it is coming essentially the output energy. And so this is the output work, or essentially how much work a column of water could do on the output side. And it's an equivalent volume of water, remember that. So in some period, and these equal each other. So this setup, this is Bernoulli's equation, but let's see if we can clean it up so that we can get rid of variables that we don't have to know about. So one thing know. Well, let's make everything consistent. I wrote 2's here. So let's just, let me use Bernoulli's equation to do something useful. And you should memorize this, and it shouldn't be too hard to memorize. It's pressure, and then you have this kind of potential energy term, but instead of mass, you have density, and you have this kind of kinetic energy term. It's not kinetic energy anymore, because we manipulated it some. But instead of mass, you have density. So with that said, let's do a problem. I'll keep this down actually let's say it has a top to it. It has a top to it, and I have some fluid in it. Maybe it happens to be red. We haven't been dealing with the red fluids as yet. So let me, oh, I didn't want to do that. So let's just, you know, you know there's a fluid there. And let's say that there's no air here, so. So with that said, let's see what we can do about figuring out the velocity coming out. Well Bernoulli's equation tells us that the input pressure plus the input potential energy plus the input kinetic energy is equal to the output, et cetera, et cetera. So what is the input pressure? Well, the input pressure, the pressure at this point, there's no air or no fluid above it. So the pressure at that the input velocity times area one is equal to the output velocity times 1 1 thousandth of area one. So we could say area one over a thousand. Divide both sides by area one. So we know that the input velocity is equal to v two over a thousand. So that's good to know. So these are the three input.\", 'Physics'], [\" Where I left off in the last video we saw that if we had a magnetic field coming in from the right and we had this loop of, I guess we call it, metal or a circuit and it's carrying a current where the current is coming in this direction. You can imagine positive protons, although we know the electrons go in the other direction. But if the current is coming in this direction and going out that direction, we figured out using the right hand rule and just this formula that the net force of the magnetic of coming at an angle out of the page. So only some of this net outward force from the magnetic field is going to be perpendicular to the moment arm. And so the torque on it will be less, but it's still going to be torque in that same direction, kind of coming out of the page on the right and into the page on the left. And the same is true of the left hand side. And then you go all the way to the point that the of angular momentum that keeps this object rotating. And then it will rotate to, and this is where it gets interesting. I'll draw it neatly. Then it'll rotate to this point. Once again, I want draw to the right. The current is coming like that, like that, like that, going up here, and to the right, up like that, right? So the current, now on this left hand side, although it was the former right hand side, it's still going in that upwards direction. So when you take the cross product, what is going to be the net magnetic field on. So now the force of the magnetic field is out on this side and you're going to want to rotate in the opposite direction. Hopefully that makes sense. Just think about what happens. Visualize this coil rotating. So what is essentially going to happen is you're going to rotate like I did here on the top. Maybe once you get to the magnetic field to get it going in the other direction. And actually you have another problem which is a slightly lesser problem. the right hand rule and you'll figure out, well, the net force from the magnetic on the top stays exactly the same. So at the vertical configuration, and I'm trying my best to draw this properly, at the vertical configuration, one of two things could happen. And probably the best thing is, is that we actually lose contact with the two leads. So maybe the actual current stops flowing when we're in the vertical configuration. I'll do it in the same color. So when we're vertical, we just see the top, we see this.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. We'll now use a little bit of what we've learned about work and energy and the conservation of energy and apply it into simple machines and we'll learn a little bit about mechanical advantage. So I've drawn a simple lever here and you've probably been exposed to simple levers before. They're really just kind of like a seesaw. This place where the lever pivots, this is called the fulcrum, just really the pivot point. And you can kind of view this as either a seesaw or a big plank of wood on top of a triangle, which essentially to draw the finishing position. So the finishing position is going to look something like this. Try my best to draw it. The finishing position is something like this. Oh, and also one thing I want to figure out I wanted to write is let's say that the distance, that this distance right here from where I'm applying the force to the fulcrum, let's say that. This is the opposite, this is a 90 degree angle, right? Because we started off at level. So this is opposite and this is what? This is the adjacent angle, right? So what do we have there? Opposite over adjacent. So, cah, toa. Opposite over adjacent. Opposite over adjacent. That's toa or tangent. So in this situation, we both equal to tangent of theta. So they most, we don't even have to figure out what the tangent of theta is. We know that this quantity is equal to this quantity, right? And we could write it here. We could write the distance of the force. That's the distance that we have to push down on the side of the lever downwards over 2 is equal to the distance of the weight. The distance of the weight traveled upwards is equal to the distance of the force. So this is the work in force times the distance of the force. I'm going to switch colors just to keep things interesting. And that has to be the same thing as the workout. Right? Well, what's the workout? Well, it's the force of the weight pulling downwards. So this is interesting and I think you'll see where this is going and we did a little complicated this time but hopefully you'll realize a general theme. This was a 10-Newton weight and I only had to press down with 5 Newtons in order to realize now is that proportion, the proportion of the mechanical advantage was actually the ratio of this length to this length. And we figured that out by taking the tangent and doing these ratios. But in general, it makes sense because this force times this distance has to be equal to this force times this distance. And this is really all you need to know. And this just all falls out of the work in is equal to the workout. Now, this quantity isn't exactly the work in. The work in was this force, sorry, F2, is this force times this distance. But this distance is proportional, is going to be proportional to this distance. And that's what you need to realize.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. I'll now do a couple of more momentum problems. So this first problem, I have this ice skater and she's on an ice skating rink. And what she's doing is she's holding a ball and this ball, let me draw the ball. This is a.15 kilogram ball. It's a.15 kilogram ball if you're not familiar with the term recoil, it's often applied to when someone, I guess, you know, not that we want to think about violent things, but if you shoot a gun, your shoulder recoils back, because once again momentum is conserved. So there's a later? Well we have a ball moving at 35 meters per second, and the ball has a mass of 0.15 kilograms. So it's 0.15 kilograms. I'll ignore the units for now just to see if space. Times the velocity of the ball. Times 35 meters per second. So this because the initial velocity is zero. So let's subtract.5.25 from both sides, and then the equation becomes minus 5.25 is equal to 49.85 times the velocity of the scalar. So we're essentially saying that the momentum of just the ball is 5.25, and since the combined about, well, about 10 centimeters, about, yeah, roughly 10 centimeters per second. So she will recoil a lot slower, although she will move back. And if you think about it, this is a form of propulsion. This is how rockets work. They eject something that maybe has less mass, but super fast. And that, since we have a conservation of momentum, it makes the rocket move in the other direction. Anyway, let's see if we could do\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. So I was trying to rush and finish a problem in the last two minutes of the video and I realized that's just bad teaching because I end up rushing. So this was a problem we were going to work on and you'll see a lot of these. They just wanted to become familiar with the variables and the Newton's law of gravitation. So I said that, so mass of me, so m sub m, times the mass of earth divided by what? We learned in the last video divided by the distance between me and the center of the mass of earth, really my center of mass and the center of mass of earth. But that's half the mass of Earth, so I'll just write that. So it's 1 half the mass of Earth. And what's the radius? What's the radius now? I could just write the radius of the small planet squared, but I'll say, well, we know it's 1 half the radius of Earth, so let's put that in there. So two times the force applied on Earth when I go to Earth. And that's something interesting to think about because you might have said initially, wow, you know, gravity, the mass of the object matters a lot in gravity, the more mass And one thing I want you to realize, actually, before I finish this video since I do have some extra time, when we think about gravity, especially with planets and all of that, you always feel like, oh, it's earth pulling on me. You always feel like, let's say that this is the earth, and the earth is huge, and this is, let's say this is a tiny spaceship right here, million newtons. It actually turns out that the spaceship will be pulling on the earth with the same force of one million newtons. And they're both going to be moved to the combined system center of mass. And the combined system center of mass, since the earth is so much more massive, is going to be very close to earth center of mass. It's probably going to be very close to earth center of mass. It's going to be like right there, right? So in this situation,\", 'Physics'], [\" Now that we know a little bit about vectors and scalars, let's try to apply what we know about them for some pretty common problems you'd want. See in a physics class, but they're also common problems you'd see in everyday life because you're trying to figure out how far you've gone or how fast you're going or how long it might take you to get someplace. So first I have if Shampanu was able to travel five kilometers north in one hour that not only do I care about the value of this thing, I care about, or I care about the size of this thing, I also care about its direction. That's what the arrow, the arrow isn't necessarily its direction, you would have your rate. So this is rate or speed is equal to the distance that you travel. The distance that you travel over, over some time. So these two, you could call them kilometers, 5 kilometers, alright, just a big capital. Well let me just write it out, 5 kilometers north. Over the amount of time it took him, over the amount of time. And let me make it clear, this is change in time. Change in time. Sometimes, this is also change in time. Sometimes you'll just this is the same thing as five kilometers per hour north. So this is five kilometers per hour, per hour to the north, to the north, to the north. So that's his average velocity, five kilometers per hour. And you have to be careful depending on how you want to pronounce it, kilometers per hour. What if someone wanted to meters per second, or what if I just wanted to understand how many meters he travels in a second? And there just becomes a unit conversion problem, and I figure it doesn't hurt to work on that right now. So if we wanted to do this to meters per second, how would we do it? Well, the first step is to think about how many meters we are traveling in associative. And then in the units, in the numerator you have meters, and in the denominator you have hours. Meters per hour. And so this is equal to, this is equal to 5, second? Or another way to think about it, one hour, think about the larger unit. One hour is how many seconds? Well you haveator here is second. Meters per second. And if we divide both the numerator and the denominator by, well, I could do this by hand, but just because this video is already getting a little bit long, let me get my trusty calculator out. If I get my trusty calculator out, just for the sake of time, 5,000 divided by 3,600, which would be really the same thing as 50 divided by 3,600.\", 'Physics'], [\" So, where I left off in the last video, I just rewritten the spring equation and I just wrote, you know, force is mass times acceleration. And I was in the process of just saying, well, if X is a function of T, what's acceleration? Well, velocity is the derivative of X with respect to time, right? Your change in position over change of time. And acceleration is the derivative of velocity or the second derivative of x as a function of t. I'll write the function notation just so you remember that this is a function of time is equal to minus k times x of t. And what you see here, what I've just written, this is actually a differential equation to this differential equation is. And then if it works out, then we'll have a little bit more intuition and then we'll actually know what the position is at any given time of this mass attached to the spring. So this is exciting. This is a differential equation. When we drew the position, our intuition for the position over time, our intuition tells us that it's a cosine function with amplitude A. So we said it's A cosine omega t, you know. So it's put the up of the minus outside. So it's minus sign of Wt. And then if we want the second derivative, so that's x prime prime of t, x prime prime of t. Let me do this in a different color just so it doesn't get monotonous'm running out of space, wt. Hopefully you understand what I'm saying. I just substituted x prime prime, the spring constant, if you rewrite force as mass times acceleration, you get this, which is essentially a differential equation. I just rewrote acceleration as the second derivative. Then I took a guess that this is x of t, just based on our intuition of the drawing. I took a guess, and then I took the second derivative of it. This was the first derivative. This is the second derivative. And then I substituted the second derivative here, and I substituted the function here, and this is what I got. And so let's see, we have mw squared cosine of omega t is equal to k cosine of omega t. So this equation holds true if what is true? This equation holds true if mw squared, or omega squared, I think that's omega, I always forget my, is equal to k. Or another way of saying it, if omega squared is equal to,\", 'Physics'], [\" Now that we have distance explicitly as a function of the angle that we're shooting the object at, we can use a little bit of calculus to figure out the optimal angle, the angle that's going to optimize our distance. And since we only care about angles from zero degrees to really 90 degrees, let's constrain ourselves. So we're going to optimize things for angles between zero degrees. So theta is going to be greater what we want to do is find the angle, there's some angle here, there's some angle here that gives us the optimal distance. So this is right here, this is the optimal, optimal, the optimal distance. And what we want to do is find that out. And when you look at the graph, and you could do it on a graphing calculator if you like, what happens to the instantaneous slope In the product rule, we take the derivative of the first function times the second function. So the derivative of cosine of theta is negative sine of theta. And we're going to multiply that times the second function. So that's times sine of theta. And to that, we're going to add the first function, which is cosine of theta times sine of theta, that's just negative sine squared of theta. And then cosine theta times cosine theta, that's just plus cosine squared of theta. Now, what we just said is we want to figure out the point, the angle at which this derivative or the instantaneous slope is zero. So let's set this thing equal to zero. So we just have to solve for theta now. Now the first thing I do to solve of theta. Now, both of these are going to be positive over the interval, so we're going to take the positive square root of both of them, or the principal root of both sides of this equation. So let's do that. So you take the principal roots of both sides of this equation. You can do it that way, actually, in a more interesting way than doing it that way, is to divide both sides of this equation by cosine squared of theta, assuming that it's not equal to the tangent squared of theta. Or we could take the positive square root of both sides of this equation. Tangent is positive over the interval from 0 to 90 degrees, so that's cool to do. So if you take the positive square root of both sides, you get the positive square root of one is one. One is equal to tangent of theta. Tangent of theta. And then you take the off at 45 degrees, what is the sine of 45 degrees? The sine of 45 degrees is equal to the square root of 2 over 2. You could use a calculator for that or maybe you know it from the unit circle. The cosine of 45 degrees is also square root of 2 over 2. And if you'd actually just taken the principal roots at this stage of the equation, you'd have gotten that the cosine of theta is the S squared S squared over G. Assuming no air resistance, kind of an ideal circumstance, but no matter what planet you're on, how fast you do it, the best angle is always 45 degrees assuming no air resistance. And if you do it on that best angle, you're going to travel S squared over G. So if S, going back to the original problem, if S is 10 meters per second, let's say S was\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's learn a little bit about fluids. So, a, and you probably have some notion of what a fluid is, but let's talk about it in the physics sense, or maybe even in the chemistry sense, depending on in what context you're watching this video. So, fluid is anything that takes the shape of its container. So, for example, if I had a, I don't know, a glass sphere, a glass sphere, let's of container. And I just gave you two examples of fluids. You have liquids, liquids, and you have gases. Those are two types of fluids. Both of those things take the shape pressure you put from any side on it. While if this was filled with gas and magenta balloon for gas, you actually could decrease the volume by just increasing the pressure on all sides of the balloon. And you could actually squeeze it and make the entire volume smaller. So that's a disreener liquid in a gas. Gas is compressible, liquid this one is bigger. And let's fill this thing with some liquid, which will be blue. So that's my liquid. Let's fill it with some. So the force times distance in is equal to force times distance out. Force in ask you a question. How much water did I displace? How much total water did I displace? Well it's this volume. I took this entire volume and pushed it down. So what's the volume right there that I dis do we know what distance that's going to be? Well, the volume that it changes here has to, it's got to go someplace, right? You've got to say, well, that's going to push on that. That's all going to push. And that liquid has to go someplace. And essentially, it's going to end up, it might not be the exact same molecules, but that might displace some liquid here. That's going to displace some liquid here, and here, and here, and here. And all the way until the liquid up here gets displaced and gets pushed upward. So the volume that you're pushing down here is the same.\", 'Physics'], [\" I want to make a quick clarification to the last video and then think about what friction up to when the block is actually moving. So in the last video we started off with the block being stationary. We knew that the parallel component of the force of gravity on that block was 49 Newtons downwards down the slope and when so the block was stationary we said there must be an offsetting force and we said that's the force of friction and it must be 49 Newtons upwards and I started to press on it a little bit apply a little bit of force. Maybe I have tried a tenth of a Newton on top of that. Then the force of friction was 49th and one tenth Newton because it was still providing enough force so that this block was not moving. Then maybe I applied half a Newton. And so the total force in the downward direction would have been 49 and a half Newtons. But if it was still was not moving, then the force of friction was still completely overcoming it. So the force of friction at is parallel to the plane right there is 49 Newtons. We know that this is 49 Newtons. We know the component of gravity that is perpendicular to the plane. We figured out this two videos ago is 49 square roots of 3 Newtons. We know that this block is not accelerating in this the ramp. So it's in this direction right over here. So that's the constant velocity. So what are all the forces at play? And be very careful here. There might be a temptation to say, OK, you know, there's a net force here. We're moving. So maybe that's the net force is causing the move. But remember, remember, this's keeping it at a constant velocity, that is completely negating the parallel component of the force of gravity, parallel to the surface of this plane. So given this, let's calculate another coefficient of friction, but this is going to out this coefficient of kinetic friction. And what's cool about this is this is in general going to be true for any two materials that are like this. So, you know, maybe this a situation where static friction is lower, the coefficient of static friction, at least that I know of, is lower than kinetic friction, but you do see situations where the coefficient of kinetic friction\", 'Physics'], [\" In this video I want to clarify two ideas that we talk about on a regular basis, but they're really kind of muddled up in our popular language. And these are the ideas of mass, mass, and weight. And first, I'll tell you what they are, and then we'll talk about how they are muddled up. So mass is literally, there's a couple of ways to view mass. One way to view mass is, and this is not a technical force, something with higher mass will accelerate less. Now weight, weight is the force of gravity on a mass or on attraction between two objects, so the force of gravity between two objects is going to be big G, the universal gravitational constant, times the mass weight on the surface of the earth is this 9.8 meters per second squared, 9 due to gravity on an object, on a mass. So if I go someplace else, if I go to the moon, for example, my weight will change. But my mass will not. So let's write this. This is the weight on earth. If I were to take my weight on. Your weight would actually even change as you, as you, as you, if you went to a very high altitude because you're getting slightly further, it would be immeasurably small, but you're getting slightly further from the center of the earth. Your weight would change an imperceptible amount. In fact, because the earth is not a perfect sphere, because the me is 160 pounds. But then you might say, well, what is mass then if you're talking about the English system or sometimes called the imperial system? And here I will introduce you to a concept that very few people know. It's kind of a good trivial concept. The both sides by 32 feet per second squared. So let's do that. Let's divide both sides by 32 feet per second squared. Divide both sides by 32 feet per second squared. Cancels out. And then let me get my calculator out. So I have 160 pounds\", 'Physics'], [\" This right here is a picture of an Airbus A380 aircraft. And I was curious how long would it take this aircraft to take off? And I looked up its take off velocity. So take off velocity. And the specs I got were 280 kilometers per hour. And to make this a velocity, we have to specify it this way, meters per second per second can also be written as meters per second squared. I find this a little bit more intuitive, this is a little bit neater to write. So let's figure this out. So the first thing that I, so we're trying to answer is how long, how long does take off last? Take off, how long does take so you have one of the larger unit is equal to 3600 of the smaller unit. And so we can multiply by that. And if we do that, the hours will cancel out and we'll get 280 divided by 3600 kilometers per second. But I want to do all my math at once. So let's also do the conversion from kilometers to meters. So once again, we have, we have kilometers in the numer. But let me just divide that by 3,600. And it gives me 77.7 repeating indefinitely. And it looks like I had two significant digits in each of these original things. I had 1.0 over here. Not 100% clear how many significant digits I over here. Was the spec rounded to the nearest 10 kilometers? Or was it exactly 280 kilometers per hour? Just to be safe, I'll assume that it'll be going one meter per second. After two seconds, it'll be going two meters per second. After three seconds, it'll be going three meters per second. So how long will it take to get to 78 meters per second? Well, it'll take 78 seconds. It will take 78 seconds, or roughly a minute and 18 seconds. And just to verify this with our definition of our acceleration, so to speak, just Well, we're starting off with the velocity, or we're assuming we're starting off with the velocity of 0 meters per second, and we're getting up to 78 meters per second. So our change in velocity is the 78 meters per second. So our change in velocity is 70.\", 'Physics'], [\" Well, I told you that the two most important things you should know in thermodynamics, and that'll get you, most of your way through most exams, is that the pressure times the volume is equal to a constant, and the pressure times the volume divided by the temperature is equal to a constant. And so they all change such that, you know, the initial pressure times the volume times the initial, divided by the initial temperature is equal to the final pressure times the volume divided by the final temperature, assuming that you're not changing the energy and the volume, the volume of the balloon is, let's say it's one meter cube. So this is a big balloon. That's fairly large if you imagine a cubic meter. So the volume is a cubic meter. Let's say the pressure is equal to, I don't know, let's say there's not a lot. So whatever our Celsius temperature is, add 273. So add 273 to that, you get 293 Kelvin. So let's see, I get 5 times 1, and meter squared, meter cubed, this cancels out, this just becomes a meter, Newton meter's joules, 5 joules is equal to 5 joules times 1 over that, 1 over 2, 4, 3, 4, 0.83. And then since we're dividing by this, this flips moles per joule. And then of course this joule cancels with this joule, so we just have to divide 5 by this and we'll get the number of moles. So let's take the inverse of what I is more I know you can't read that so if I have point 0 2 1 moles how many molecules I have well I just multiply that 0 0 2 1 times How many moles per molecule right because this is moles let me write that moles to the 23. And what's 0.01? That's 10 to the negative 2. 10 to the negative 1 is 0.1, so this is 10 to the negative 2. So then we get 1.26, 10 to the negative 2 times 10 to the negative 3, we add the exponents, times 10 to the 21st power.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say I have something moving with a constant velocity of 5 meters per second and where's assuming it's moving to the right just to give us a direction because this is a vector quantity so it's moving in that direction right over there. And let me plot its velocity against time. So this is change in position over change in time. Or another way to think about it, if you multiply both sides by change in time, you get velocity times change in time is equal to displacement. So what was the displacement, because displacement is just the velocity times the change in time. So it's just, if you just take out a rectangle right over there. So let me draw a slightly different one where the velocity is changing. And so let me draw a situation where you have a constant acceleration. The acceleration over here is going to be one meter per second per second. So one meter per second squared. And let me draw the same type of graph. I'm just gonna look a little different now. So this is just a fancy way of saying my initial speed is zero. So my initial speed is zero. So after one second, what's going to happen? After one second, I'm going one meter per second faster. So now I'm going one meter per second. After two seconds, what's happened? Well, I'm going another meter per second faster than that. After another second, if I go forward in time, if change in time is one second, then I'm And my question to you is how far have we traveled, which is a slightly more interesting question than what we've been asking so far. So we start off with an initial velocity of zero, and then for five seconds, we accelerate at one meter per second squared. So one, two, three, four, five. So this is where we are so forth. But I think what you see as you're getting is the more accurate, the smaller the rectangles you try to make here, the closer you're going to get to the area under this curve, the area under this curve. And just like the situation here, this area under the curve is going to be the distance, is going to be the distance traveled, the distance traveled. 5 meters per second.\", 'Physics'], [\" So what I had left off is we had this circuit. We had these little leads here. This was kind of our innovation. And this is actually called a commutator, where this part that's connected to our rotating piece, that's the commutator. And these are the brushes. So you can imagine you could design them as brushes that always stay in touch. Kind of like the brushes on a, what was that? What are those cars at the amusement park? Bumper cars, right? On the bumper cars, we have the current going down like this. And then if you use your right hand rule with the cross product, you know that the net force from the magnetic field is going to be downwards on the left hand side, upward on the right hand side. So you have a net torque rotating it like that, rotating the right out of the page, the left into the page or into the'll now, okay. That's my positive negative, positive negative current flows like this. Now we assume that the commutator has gotten back in touch and I just want, let me color code this. So if this side is this color, right, then this side, now this is when we're connected to this lead, it's now connected to this lead, and this green side is now connected to this lead. So something interesting happens. Now the current on the left side is still flowing down, and the current on the right side is still flowing up. So we're back to this configuration, except that this contraption has flipped over. The brown side is now on the left, and the green side the page on the right hand side and then down on the left hand side. And you could actually turn a wheel now. You could create an electric car. So that is the basics really of how electric motors are created. I mean, what most electric, well, there's another way you could have done it. You didn't have to use the commentator. One methodology you could have used is\", 'Physics'], [\" After all the work we've been doing with fluids, you probably have a pretty good sense of what pressure is. But now let's think a little bit about what it really means, especially when we think about it in terms of a gas in a volume. And remember, what was the difference between a gas and a liquid? They're both fluids. They both take the shape of their containers, but a essentially that they're all elastic bumps between the different molecules. So there's no loss of momentum. So let's keep that in mind, and everything you're going to see in high school and on the AP test are going to deal with ideal gases. So let's think, you know, we're looking at time over a, you know, a super small fraction of time. Over that period of time, this one might end up here. You know, this one maybe bumped into it right after Ricochet came amount of time. And so the force exerted on this wall or this surface is going to be whatever, x. And if we know what that force is and we know the area of the wall, we at any point within the gas because it will all become homogenous at some point and we'll talk about entropy in future videos. But the pressure in the container and on its surface times the volume of the container is equal to some constant. And we'll see in future videos that that constant is actually proportional to the average kinetic each of the molecules might have a different kinetic energy. It's always changing because they're always transferring momentum to each other. But on average, they all have a given kinetic energy, right? And they keep bumping at a certain rate into the wall and that kind of determines the pressure. Now what happens if, I don't know, I were able to squeeze the box. So if I were able to decrease, if I were able to decrease the volume of the box if I squeeze the volume, the pressure increases. And another intuition, if I have a balloon, what blows up a balloon? Well, it's the internal air pressure of the helium or your own exhales that you put into the balloon. And the more and more you try to squeeze a balloon, let's say if you squeeze it from all directions, you have to be, it gets harder and harder to do it. And that's because the pressure with the\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is show you a way to represent a vector by its components. And this is sometimes called engineering notation for vectors. But it's super useful because it allows us to keep track of the components of the vector. And it makes it a little bit tangible when we talk about the individual components. So let's break down this vector right over here. I'm just assuming it's a velocity. I said that that vector itself is 5 meters per second, but what I told you is that the direction is implicitly given because this is a vertical vector, and I told you in previous videos that if it's positive it means up, and if it's negative it means down. So I kind of have to give you this context here so that you can appreciate that this is a vector, that just the sign of it is giving you its direction. But I kept having to tell you in the horizontal direction, if it's positive, it's going to the right, and if it's negative, it's going to the left. What I want to do in this video is give us a convention so that I don't have to keep you, remember this is a horizontal vector. Positive is to the right, negative is to the left. It's implicit here because clearly if this is a positive value, it's going to be a positive multiple of i. It instead of saying that it's implicitly upwards because it's a vertical vector, or it's a vertical component and it's positive, we can now be a little bit more specific about it. We can say that it is equal to, it is equal to 5 times j. 5 times j. Because you see this magenta vector, it's going the vector. And we can write that, the x component vector is five square roots of three times i, and then it's going to be plus the y component, the vertical component, which is five j, which is five times j. And so what's really neat here is now\", 'Physics'], [\" Just to realize that I typed in the wrong numbers at the end of the last video when I was trying to put them in the calculator, we were trying to determine the coefficient of static friction and it's 50 Newtons divided by 49 square roots of 3 Newtons. And in the last video by accident in the calculator, instead of doing 49 square roots of 3, I wrote 40 square roots of 3. So let's actually calculate it again. 50 divided by 49 times, let me write it this way, make sure we get 49 times the square root of 30.\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say I have a horizontal pipe at the left end of the pipe. Let's say at the left end of the pipe. The area, the cross-sectional area, so I'll call that area 1. Let's say that that is, I don't know, let's say it's equal to 6,000 Pascal's. And so given this information, let's say we have water in this pipe. There's just generally, so I could draw water. And we're assuming that it's laminar flow, so there's no affriction within the pipe, and there's no turbulence and all of that. So using that V2 is equal to 2 r. So this immediately tells us that V2 is coming out at a faster rate, right? Just based on the size of the openings. And then we also know, because V2 is coming out v1? Well, that's r over 2. We figure that out up here. So, v times rho r squared is equal to 16 rho r squared. And subtract rho r squared from both sides of this equation. We get 32,000 is equal to, well this is 1 rho r squared. This is 16 rho r squared. So this is 15 r equal to 2.1 and then I take a square root of that 1.46. So the answer is r is equal to 1.46 meters cubed per second. So that's the volume of water that is either entering the square root of 1.46 meters cubed per second.\", 'Physics'], [\" Everything in human experience and really human history or human civilizations experience is that everything seems to fall to the earth. That if they have water particles, if they're large enough, they don't just float up. They're small enough they're being held up by the wind and all of that. But if they're large enough, they will fall. That you don't have people that are able to just float around. They'll fall. You don't have taxi cabs that float around his place in history. But this, as you might already know, But for Isaac Newton, at least on that day, when he observed that apple, he says, well, you know, why did that? Why did that apple fall? And this to some degree is a great example of out-of-box thinking, because something that for thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years, human beings had taken for granted, just because that's the way it always was, he actually asked the question, why? Does it always haveitation, either way. And in it, he theorizes that the force between two objects, and it's a vector quantity, it's always going to attract the two objects to each other. So the direction is towards each other. The force of gravity between two objects is going to be equal to this big G, which is on Earth, maybe it's me, and then this is the distance from between the center of masses of both of those objects. So between the center of me, if you're, and I won't go into the detail of that, I'll make a more detailed video on center of masses, and the center of the Earth. So it's roughly the distance from the surface of the Earth, or if I'm about five foot nine, about half of that distance of, you know, where I guess the distance from my belly button about to the center of the Earth is this number is really small. And there actually is. There actually is some force of attraction between you and the computer. It's just that it's more than over compensated for the friction between the, which are in kilograms, and divide it by a distance, which is in meters, you will end up with newtons. But I want to make it clear that this is a super small number, 10 to the negative 11th. If I were to just the mass of earth right over here, if you put it in right over there, and if you put in roughly the distance from the surface of the earth to the center of the earth, therefore R, and you multiply that times G, all of these terms right over here. So I have a mass of 70 kilograms. Weight is actually a force, but we'll talk, we'll clarify that more later. My mass is 70 kilograms. Then we can figure out the force that the earth is pulling down on me, which is actually my weight. So in this situation, the force is going to be g, which is 9.8, the on Sal with a force of 686 Newtons, and Sal is also pulling on the earth with a force of 686 Newtons. So Sal is also pulling on the earth. It makes me feel very powerful with a force of 686 Newtons. But you might say, wait, that doesn't make sense, Sal. If I have a building over here, and if you figure out how much is the earth accelerating from that force, you're going to get a, I won't even put it here, you're going to put a huge number in here, huge number times the acceleration of earth towards me. And since this is such a huge number, very, very, very large number, this is going to be an immeasurably small number, super, super small number.\", 'Physics'], [\" We're now ready for Newton's third law of motion and something once again you've probably heard people talk about but in this video I want to make sure that we really understand what Newton is talking about when he says this is a translation of the Latin version of it to every action there is always and just so you clear Newton was English but he wrote it in Latin because at that point in time people wrote things't look like ice. I'm doing more ice like color. So the block is sitting on maybe some ice like that. So Newton's third law saying, look, I can press on this block and sure I'll exert a net force on this block and that net force will accelerate the block assuming is getting compressed. The palm of your hand is being pressed down. And that's because the desk is exerting an equal and opposite force on you. If it wasn't, you actually wouldn't even feel it because you wouldn't even feel the pressure. It would feel your hand would be completely uncompressed. Another example of that. Say you're walking in the beach. Say you're walking on the beach and you have some sand right here. If you believe Newton's second law, if you have this gravitational force on you, you should be accelerating downwards unless there is some other force that balances it out. And the force that balances it out is the force that the beach or the sand is exerting on you upwards. And so when you net them out, there's a zero net force on you. And that's why you get to stay there, why you don't start accelerating down towards the center of the gas. And so that's what allows a rocket to accelerate even when there's nothing in this directive that you need to push off of. It just expels a bunch of things that it or it accelerates a bunch of things that are super fast-rated, but exerts a force on all these particles and that allows an equal and opposite force to accelerate the rocket ahead. And another example of this is if you ever find yourself drifting in space and this is an actual useful example so that you don't end up drifting in space So, let's say that this is... This is the glove of the astronaut. There you go. That's his hand. That's the astronaut's hand right over here. And let's say he finds some piece of equipment on his or she finds some piece of equipment on them that they can throw. They can take off of their...\", 'Physics'], [\" So let's say we have a cup of water. Let me draw the cup. That's the bottom of the cup. Let's see, the other side of the cup. And it's water. Well, let me say it's some liquid. It doesn't have to be water. Some arbitrary liquid. It could be water. So that's the surface of it. So we've already learned that the pressure at any in one direction or let's say the pressure down were greater than the pressure up, then the object would start accelerating downwards, right? Because its surface area pointing upwards is the same as the surface area pointing downwards. So the force upwards would be more and it would start accelerating downwards. So even though the pressure is a function of depth, is that at this point, the pressure is going to be higher, I don't know how much higher, than at this point, right? Because this point is deeper into the water. So let's call this P1, that's the pressure on top, PT. And let's call this point down you know, do the minus confidently up here. Minus the pressure at the top, so what's the force at the top? The force at the top is going to be the pressure on the top times the surface area of the top of both of those back into our net force. Let me switch colors to keep from getting monotonous. So I get the net force is equal to the pressure at the bottom, which is this. And let's just multiply it out so we get P times gravity. Well, let me ask you a question. What is d cubed? D cubed is the volume of this cube, right? And what else is it? Well, it's also the volume of the water displaced, right? If I stick this cube into the water and the cube isn't shrinking or anything, that, and let me, I mean, you can even imagine it being empty. It doesn't have to be empty. But that amount of water has to be moved out of the way in order for's a pretty interesting thing. So if I submerge anything, the net force acting upwards on it, or the amount that I'm lighter by, is equal to the weight of the water being displaced. And that's actually called Archimedes principle. And that net upward force, due to the fact that there's more pressure on the bottom than there is on the top, that's called the buoyant force. And that's what makes things float.\", 'Physics'], [\" I will now do a presentation on the center of mass. The center of mass, I'll hopefully, is something that will be a little bit intuitive to you and actually has some very neat applications. In very simple terms, the center of mass is a point. Let me draw an object. Let's say that this is my object. Let of mass, let's say 10 Newtons, right? So the mass of the whole ruler is 10 kilograms. If a force is applied at the center of mass, this ruler will accelerate the same exact way as would a point mass. means, let's say, I mean for simple purposes, if it's made out of the same thing and that thing that it's made out of, it's density, doesn't really change throughout the object, the center of mass is, will be the object's geometric center. So in this case, this is all, you't going to be the geographic center. I don't know how much denser lead is in styrofoam, but the center of mass is going to be someplace closer to the right because this object does not have a uniform density. And it'll actually depend on how much denser the lead is in the styrofoam, which I don't know. But hopefully that gives you a little intuition of what the center of that direction. But now I will throw in a twist. And actually every problem we did, all of these Newton's laws problems, we assumed that the force acted at the center of mass. But something more interesting happens if the force acts away from the center of mass. So let me see. Actually, let me actually take that ruler example. I don't know why I do. But if you did and while the monkey wrench is spinning in the air, it's spinning around its center of mass. Same for a knife, if you're a knife catcher, that's something you should think about. The object when it's free, when it's not fixed at any point, it rotates around its center of mass. That's very interesting. So you can actually throw random objects and that point at which it rotates around, in which case your center of mass would have to, you know, cross over the bar. And we could figure out this mass and we could figure out how much energy and how much force is required to propel a mass that high because we know projectile motion and we know all of Newton's laws. But what you see a lot in the Olympics is people doing a very strange type of jump where when they're going over the bar they look something like this. Their backs are arched\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is tackle a problem that would be considered pretty difficult for most first year physics students. And you frankly probably wouldn't be expected to solve a problem like this in most first year physics class or if you're in an advanced or honors class you might be expected or it might be a bonus problem. But it's an interesting type of problem because what we're going to do is we're going to launch a projectile on an incline. So maybe we're on the side down the hill it lands, the higher the vertical displacement. So we have to think about both the horizontal and the vertical displacement at the same time. And as we walk through this, you'll see how that can some of the stuff I just drew just so it makes it a little bit cleaner. And the horizontal component of our velocity is going to be, by the same logic, 10 cosine of 45 degrees. Now let's think about what the horizontal displacement is going to be our initial vertical velocity, 5 square roots of 2, times this gives us our, this gives us our vertical displacement as a function of time. Let's think about our horizontal displacement as a function of time. Our horizontal displacement is going to be equal to our horizontal velocity, which is 5 square roots of 2 times our change in time. Times our change in time. Now what can we do basic trigonometry. We have a right triangle. We know the opposite side from the angle, we know the adjacent side, and the trig function that uses the opposite and the adjacent is the tangent function. So we get the tangent of 30 degrees is going to be equal to the magnitude of our vertical displacement over the magnitude root of 3 is equal to 1 over the square root of 3. What's useful about this is it gives us a relationship between our horizontal and vertical component, or between our vertical and our horizontal components, and we can use this constraint right over here to then solve for one of these two, and let me show you how we'll do it. So let's just explicitly write this. So if we multiply, well, let's do it this way. Let us cross multiply here, which is really the, if we divide both sides by 5 square roots of 2, we get our change in time is equal to the horizontal component of our displacement divided by 5 square roots of 2. But we also know that the horizontal component of our displacement is the square root of 3 times the vertical component of our displacement. And we are, we, this expression right here contains this information, contains the ratio between our vertical displacement and our horizontal displacement and it also contains the information of how does the horizontal displacement, how does that change as a function of time? So this, our time is, needs to be equal to this. So this is our constraint. This is just simplified. So then we have minus 4.9 times delta t squared. So delta t squared is this quantity squared. I'll just write it out. So I don't want to skip too many steps. So delta t, once again, is the square root of three minus one, minus one, times our vertical component, times our vertical component, because if we subtract this from both sides, that's square root of three times our vertical component, minus one times our vertical component. So that's the square root of three minus one times our vertical component,. So we factored one of them out. So the vertical component of our displacement could either be, so we have the product of two things, they equal zero. So our vertical displacement could be zero, which is true, because at some point in the path, we literally had zero vertical displacement. That was literally where we started, but that's not the answer we're looking for. We're looking for this vertical displacement. So either this is going to be zero, but that's where we are, times this, times our vertical component, this could also be equal to zero. Either this is zero or that is zero. When this is zero, it gives us the obvious answer. We're more interested in this. To solve for this, we can add this to both sides and we get 0.732 is equal to negative.49 meters. This is exciting. This is equal to 2.49 meters. And now we can figure out the horizontal displacement pretty easily because we know that the horizontal displacement is squared 3 times the vertical displacement. So let's figure that out. That's the vertical displacement. Let's multiply that times the square root of 3. And we get 4.31 meters. So we get the horizontal displacement.\", 'Physics'], [\" We're now going to learn a little bit about gravity. And just so you know, gravity is something that, especially in introductory physics or even reasonably advanced physics, we can learn how to calculate it, we can learn how to realize what are the important variables in it. But it's something that's really not well understood. Even once you learn general relativity, if you do get there, I have to say, you know, you can kind of say, oh, well, it's, you know, the warping of space time and all this. But that's my earth. And let's say we want to figure out the gravitational acceleration on sal. That's me. That's sal times 10 to the negative 11. And we want to know the acceleration on sal. So M1 is the mass of sal. And I don't feel like revealing my mass in this video, so I'll just leave it as a variable. And then what's the mass 2? It's the mass of Earth. And I wrote that here I also looked it up on Wikipedia, 6,371 kilometers. How many meters is that? It's 6 million meters, right? And then the extra meter to get to my center mass, we can ignore from now, because it'd be 001, so we'll ignore that for now. So it's 6, and I'll write it in scientific notation since everything else is in scientific notation. 6.371 times 10 to the negative 24th, we can just add the exponents, because the same base. So what's 24 minus 11 is 10 to the 13th, right? And then what does the denominator look like? It's going to be the 6.37 squared times 10 to the 6th squared. Well, 10 to the, so it's going to be whatever this is going to be like 37 or something times, what's 10 to the 6th squared? It's 10 to the 12th, right? 10 to the 12th. So let's figure out what's 10 to the 13th divided by 10 to the 12th is what? Well actually, no, this isn't 9.81, sorry, it's 0.981. 0.981 and then 10 to the 13th divided by 10 to the 12th is just 10, right? 10 to the 1st times 10. So it's 0.981 times 10. Well, so the force is equal to 9.81 times the mass of cell. And where does this get? How can we figure out the acceleration right now? Well, acceleration, force is just mass times acceleration.\", 'Physics'], [\" So I've got this block of wood here that has a mass of 5 kilograms and it's sitting on some dirt and the coa, and we're near the surface of the earth, and the coefficient of static friction between this type of wood and this type of dirt is 0.60 and the coefficient of kinetic friction. It's the ratio between that and the magnitude of the force of contact between this block and the floor or the ground here. And the magnitude of that force of contract is the same thing as the normal force that the ground is applying on the block, the about what the necessary force we need to do to overcome the force of friction right here in the static situation. So the force of gravity on this block is going to be the gravitational field, which is 9.8 meters per second, times 5 kilograms. 9.8 meters per second times 5 kilograms gives us 49 kilograms meters per second, or 49 newtons down. This is the magnitude of the friction are unit lists. So the units here are still going to be in Newtons. And so this gives us, get out our calculator, this gives us 49 times 0.6 gives us 29.4 Newtons. This is equal to, let me write it, 29.6. I can do that in my head. I shouldn't have to look at that. 70.6 newtons for just a moment while I budge it. So just exactly while I'm budging it while we're overcoming the static friction, we have a 70.6 newton net force in the right direction. And so just for that moment95 Newton's. So it's equal to 26.95 Newton's. This is the force of friction. This is the magnitude, and it's going to go against our motion. So as soon as we start to move in that direction, the force of friction.05. So once we're moving, we have a net force to the right of 73.05 Newtons. This is the net force. This is the net force and it's acting to the right. So what is going to be, once right after we budget, how quickly will this accelerate? Well 73.05 divided by the mass, divided by five kilograms, divided by five kilograms,\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video we learned, or at least I showed you, I don't know if you've learned it yet, but we'll learn in this video, but we learned that the force on a moving charge from a magnetic field, and it's a vector quantity, is equal to the charge on the moving charge times the cross product of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field. And we use this to show you get the sense that it's a field. It pervades the space. So these are a bunch of arrows popping out. And the field is popping out. And the magnitude of the field, let's say it is.5 Teslas. Let's say I have some proton that comes speeding along. I have let's figure out the magnitude first. So how can we figure out the magnitude? Well, the cross product, well, first of all, what is the charge on a proton? Well, we don't know it right now, but my calculator has that stored in. And if you have a TI graphing calculator, right? Because these vectors are popping out of the screen. They are perpendicular to the plane that defines the screen, right? While this proton is moving within this plane, so the angle between them, if you can visualize it in three dimensions, is then the number four, they have a little constant above it, you get their constant functions or their values and you say the built in, I'll accurately write the built in function. So let me press F1. And they have a bunch of, you know, this is Avogadro's number and they have a bunch of, you know, a bunch of interesting. This is the charge of an electron, which is write that down. So the magnitude of this force, right? That was a magnitude. The magnitude of this force is equal to 4.8 times 10 to the minus 12 newtons. So that's the magnitude. Now what is the direction? pointing in the direction of the velocity vector while my middle finger is pointing the direction of the magnetic field. So my index finger is going to point straight up. So all you see is the tip of it. And then my other fingers are just going to go like that. And then my thumb is going to do what? My thumb is going to, I have, you know, force perpendicular to velocity? Well, think about it. If you have a force here and the velocity is like that, if the particles, it'll be deflected a little bit to the right. And then, since the force is always going to be perpendicular to the velocity vector, the force is going to charge like that. So the particle is actually going to go in a circle. Right? As long as it's in the magnetic field, the force applied to the particle by the magnetic field is going to be perpendicular to the velocity\", 'Physics'], [\" So far when I've told you about the dot and the cross products, I'll give you the definition as the magnitudes times either the cosine or the sine of the angle between them. But what if you're not given the vectors visually and what if you're not given the angle between them? How do you calculate the dot and the cross products? So let's say, well let me give you the definition that I've given you already. So let's sayj and k are just the unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions. And the 5 is how much it goes in the x direction. The minus 6 is how much it goes in minus 2, 7, 4. These are all the same things. You shouldn't get daunted if you see one or minus number and then we, you know, well, the purpose of this video, I don't want to get too much into the intuition. This is just how to calculate it. But it's fairly straightforward. You just multiply the x components, add that to the y components multiplied, and add that to the z components multiplied. So whenever I am given something in engineering or bracket notation and I have to find the dot product, it equals. So this is an application of matrices. So what you do is you take the determinant, so I'll draw a big determinant line, on the top line of the determinant. And this is really just a way to make you memorize how to do it. It doesn't give you much intuition, but the intuition is given by the actual definition. How much of the vectors are perpendicular to each other, multiply those magnitudes, right hand rule, figures out what direction you're pointing you don't remember how to do this, but maybe me working through it will just, we'll jog your memory. And then remember, it's plus minus plus. So then minus the sub determinant for J, what's the sub determinant for J? Well, you cross out J's row and columns, you have 5, 3, minus 2, 4. So 5, 3,. Let's get to do this in the next row. Plus 5 times 7, 35 minus, minus 2 times minus 6. So it's minus positive 12, k.\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video we showed that any external pressure on a liquid in a container is distributed evenly through the liquid. But that was only applied to, and that was called Pascal's principle. But that only applied to external pressure. Let's think a little bit about what the internal pressure is within a liquid. And we're all familiar, I think, with the notion of the deeper you go into a fluid or the deeper. That's very negative, so we won't think about that. But anyway, let's go back to the problem. Let's say within this cylinder, I have a, I don't know, it's like a thin piece of foil or something that takes up the entire area, the cross-sectional area of this cylinder. And I did that just because I want that to so whatever that mass is times the gravitational constant will equal the force down. So let's figure out what that is. So like the force down, which think you might have an intuition of if I have a cubic meter of lead, that is more, well, one lead is more dense than say, I don't know, The mass of the liquid is equal to the density of the liquid times the volume of the liquid. I could get rid of these Ls times gravity. And what's the volume of the liquid? Well the volume of the liquid is going to be the cross-sectional area of the cylinder constant, we would know the force coming down. But that's, you know, that's kind of vaguely interesting. But let's try to figure out what the pressure is, because that's what started this whole discussion, is, you know, what is the pressure when you go to deep parts of the ocean, et cetera. So this is the force. What is the pressure on this foil that have floating? Well, it's the force divided by the area of this foil. So I would take the force and divide depth of the fluid essentially, or the height of the fluid above it, times the gravitational constant, PHG. And as I said, the downward pressure is equal to the upward pressure. And how do we know that? Because we knew that the upward force is the same as the downward force. If the upward force were less, this little piece of foil would actually accelerate downwards. The fact that it's static, it's in one of the\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's learn a little bit about springs. So let's say I have a spring. Let me draw the ground. So we know what's going on with the spring. So let me say this is the floor. That's the floor. And I have a spring. It's along the floor. I'll use a thicker one just to show it to spring. Let's say the spring looks something like this. Oops, I'm still using the line tool. So this spring looks like this. This'm still using the wrong tool. It compresses, right? We're all familiar with this. We sit on a bed every day or so far. So let's say it compresses to here. And let me... Whoops. Okay. And if this was the natural place where the spring would rest, what is this distance? Well, it turns out that it is linear. What went 10 to the left. And so it says that the restorative force is going to be equal to minus k times, how much it's distorted, times minus 10. So the minus is canceled out. spring would keep compressing. And if the force was more than 5-neutons, the spring would go back this way. So the fact that I know that when I apply 5-neutons force to the left, or negative 5-neutons force, the spring is no longer moving. It means that there must be, or no longer accelerating actually. It means that there must be an equal and opposite force to the right. And that's the restorative force. Another way to think about it is if I were to let, well, I won't go in there now. So in spring constant, this k for this spring, for this material, whatever it might be, is 1 half. So we know the restorative force is equal to 1 half times the distance, right? I, this negative number tells us that the spring will essentially try to pull back with the restorative force in the other direction. So I displaced it by one meter. So then we get multiply both sides by negative one and we get k is equal to minus two. So then we can use Hooke's clock to know the equation for this to figure out the rest of the force for this particular spring. It would be minus two x. And then I said, well how much force would I have to apply to distort this spring by two meters?\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say we have some object that's moving in a circular path. So let's say this is the center of the path right over here, the center of the circle. So the object is moving in a circular path that looks something like that. A counterclockwise circular path, we could do that with clockwise as well. And what I want to do is think about how fast it is spinning or orbiting around this center, how that relates to its velocity. So let's say that this thing right over here is making five revolutions per second, and they're two pi radians per revolution, then you could do a little dimensional analysis. These cancel out, and you see you get five times two pi, which gets us, so five times two in an early physics course, how we do deal with it, even those called angular velocity, tends to be treated as angular speed. It actually is a vector quantity, and it's a little unintuitive. The vector is actually popping out of the page for this. It's actually a pseudo vector, and we'll talk more about that in the future. So it is a vector quantity, and it is dependent, the direction of the vector is dependent on which way it's spinning. So for example, when it's spinning in a counterclock tends to be denoted by an omega. A lowercase omega right there. An uppercase omega looks like this. Lowercase omega is what people tend to use for angular velocity. So there's a couple of ways that you could think about it. You could say angular velocity is equal to change in angle over a change in time. So for example, this is telling us. Give ourselves some units right over there. So the circumference over here is going to be 2 pi r 2 pi r meters. And if the, let's say that the angular velocity, let's say that the angular velocity, if we wanted in revolutions per second, is going to be omega over 2 pi revolutions per second. Omega is in radians per second, if we put it into revolutions per second, omega divided by 2 pi revolutions per second. And then let's multiply that. And let's multiply that times. We want to convert this into meters per second. So how many meters do we have per revolution? me, V is equal to the angular velocity times R. I guess we could say the magnitude of the angular velocity times the radius. Let me write that out in words. And I don't want you to be confused. I'm not saying that this is a vector quantity. If this was a vector, I would put an arrow right over there. And if this was a vector, I would put an arrow over there. And then I'd be referring to the thing that's popping out of the page. But here I'm just talking about the magnitude of the angular velocity.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome to the presentation on Torque. So if you watch the presentation on the center of mass, which you should have, you might have gotten a little bit of a glancing view of what torque is, and now we'll do a little more detail. So in general, from the center there. So if we were to try to rotate it, it would always rotate around this point. And the same thing would happen. If I were to apply a force at this point, maybe I could break the nail off the back of the And you're saying hey Sal, newtons times meters, force times distance, that looks an awful lot like work. And it's very important to realize that this isn't work and that's why we won't call this joules. Because in work, what are we doing? We are translating an object. If this is an object and I'm applying a force, I'm deal with the term torque and that's more fun because eventually we can understand concepts like torque horsepower in cars. So let's do a little bit of math. Hopefully I've given you a little bit of intuition. So let's say I had this ruler. And let's say that this is its pivot arbitrary convention in physics and it's good to know. If you are rotating clockwise, torque is negative. Well, let me go the other way. If you're rotating counterclockwise, like we were in this example, right, we're rotating counterclockwise, the opposite direction of which a clock would move in, torque is positive. And if you rotate clockwise, the other way, torque is negative. So clockwise is negative. And I I were to tell you that this object does not rotate, so if I tell you that the object is not rotating, that means that the net torque on this ruler must be zero because it's not, well, its rate of change of rotation is not changing. I should be a little exact. If I'm applying some force here and still not rotating, then we know that the net force, The net torque is zero because the object, the object, its rate of change of rotation isn't changing or if it started off not rotating, it's still not rotating. So here we get 50 minus 5F is equal to zero, 50 is equal to 5F, F is equal to 10. And if we follow the units all the way through, we would get that F is equal to 10 newtons. So that's interesting.\", 'Physics'], [\" Most physics books will tell you that the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the earth is 9.81 meters per second squared. And this is an approximation. And what I want to do in this video is figure out if this is the value we get when we actually use Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. And that tells us that the force of gravity between two objects, and so this will give us the magnitude of the force. If we want to figure out the magnitude of the acceleration, which this really is, actually didn't write this as a vector, so this is just the magnitude of the acceleration. If you wanted the acceleration, which is a vector, you'd have to say downwards or towards the center of the Earth in this case. have to divide by the mass that is being accelerated due to that force. And in this case, it is the other mass. It is the mass that's sitting on the surface. So let's divide both sides by that mass. Let's divide both sides by that mass. And this will give us the magnitude of the Earth, because if you multiply it by a mass, it tells you how much force is pulling on that mass. But with that out of the way, let's actually use a calculator to calculate what this value is. And then what I want to do is figure out, well, one, I want to compare it to the value that the textbooks give us and see maybe why it may or may not be different. And then think about how it changes as we get further and further away from the surface of the Earth. And in particular, if we want to divide that by the radius of Earth squared. So divided by the radius of Earth is, so this is in kilometers. And I just want to make sure that everything is in the same units. So 6,371 kilometers, actually let me scroll over right over here when we used the universal law of gravitation. It's actually a little bit flatter than a perfect sphere, and it definitely does not have uniform density. The different layers of the earth have different densities. R is going to be not 6,371 kilometers. It's going to be 6,000. We're going to add 400 to this, 6,771 kilometers, which is the same thing as 6,771,000 meters, which is the same thing as 6.771 times 10 to the 6 meters squared, you're left with meters per second squared, so the units work out as well. So there's an important thing to realize, and this is a misconception, we do a whole video on it earlier when we talk about the universal law of gravitation, is that there is gravity when you are in orbit up here. The only reason why it feels like there's not gravity, or it looks like there's not gravity, is that this space station is moving so fast\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video we had a 10 kilogram mass sitting on top of an incline plane and the plane had a 30 degree angle. In order to figure out what would happen to this block, we broke down the force of gravity on this block into the components that are parallel to the surface of the plane and perpendicular to the surface of the plane. And we figured that out to be 49 Newtons. It was essentially the weight of the block times the sine of this angle. And we said, look, if there's no other forces, then it would be accelerated in this direction. And to figure out how the rate of acceleration, you take the force in that direction divided by the mass of the block and dealing with a stationary block. A block that is not accelerating. So what is that force? I think you know from experience maybe, what is the difference between a block of wood on top of a block of wood and a block of ice and on top of a block of ice? A block of ice on top of a block of ice is much more slippery. There's no I want to think about, and this is something that can be determined experimentally if you have blocks and ramps, even if you don't have blocks and ramps, as long as you have some way then my budging force is 50 Newtons. And so an interesting thing that you can determine based could figure out the budging force. You can figure out exactly how much force you need I guess the force of friction, just overcome the force of friction, and just kind of get right over the most friction that can be applied by the abrasiveness of the two things, when the object is stationary. And I'll do a whole video on the difference between how this is different when an object is stationary to when it's moving. A lot of times, they are very, very, very close, but for certain materials, you have at least a noticeably different coefficient of friction when the object\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. So just to review what I was doing in the last video before I run out of time, I said that, okay, you know, conservation of energy tells us that the work I put into the system or the energy that I put into the system, because they're really the same thing, is equal to the work that I get out of the system or the energy that I get out of the system, right? And I said, well, that means that the input work is equal to the output work or that the input force times the input distance is equal to be equal to the output force times the output distance, right? This is just law of conservation of energy and everything we did with work, et cetera. So I just rewrote, I'm rewriting this equation, so if I take the input force and divide by the input area, let me switch back to green, and then let's say times distance 1? So that's the area of the 2, but at this point, the cross sectional area times this distance. Well, that's equal to this volume that I calculated in the previous video, right? We could say that's the input volume, or V1, pressure times V1, is equal to the output pressure, right? Force 2 divided by area 2, right? That's the output pressure that the water is exerting notion of pressure. So where does that help us? Well, this actually tells us, and you can do this example in multiple situations, but I like to think of it if we didn't have gravity first because gravity tends to confuse things, but we'll introduce gravity in a video or two, no, there must have been a hole in my drawing. Edit. Let me just draw the water. So I have water throughout this whole thing. And all Archimedes principle, I mean, sorry, all Pascal's principle is telling us that if I were to apply some pressure, if I were to apply some pressure here, pressure in, that that net pressure, so if I, you know, and I would have, and looks like this, where I have water in it, where there's a bunch of water, let's say, make sure I fill it so that when I do the fill, it's completely filled. It doesn't fill other things. There you go. So this is cool because's a very natural unit. So let's say my pressure in is 10 Pascal's. And let's say that my input area is 2 square meters. So if I looked at the surface of the wall there, it would be 2 square meters. And let's say was 10 Pascal's, my output pressure would also be 10 Pascal's. So I also have 10 Pascal's is equal to my out force over my out cross sectional area. So I'll have a piston here and it goes up like that. And so that's 4 meters. So I do 4 times 10. So I get 40 newtons is equal to my output force.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video is talk about the difference between vectors, vectors, and scalars. And they might sound like very complicated ideas, but we'll see over the course of the videos that they're actually very simple ideas. So first I'll give you a little bit of a definition, and then I'll give you a bunch of examples. And I think the examples will make things super clear. Hopefully they'll make things super clear. A vector is something that has a I take a ruler out and I say, wow, I've moved the brick. I have moved the brick 5 meters. So my question to you is my measurement of 5 meters? Is it a vector or a scalar? Well, if I just tell you 5 meters, you just know the size of the movement. You just know the magnitude of the movement. So if someone were to just say 5 meters to the right, or it has been moved a distance of 5 meters. Distance is a scalar quantity, I didn't tell you what direction we moved it in. Displacement is a vector quantity. We told you that it is to the right. Now let's explore this if we talk about the actual, well, we'll talk to deal with for the simple physics. So what's a measure of how fast this thing moved? So how fast did this thing move? So we could say it moved five meters in two seconds. Let me write this down. So this is a scalar quantity. And the scalar quantity for how fast something is going is speed. So we could say that the speed of the brick is 2.5 meters per second. Now, if we do the same calculation, we say it went 5 meters, 5, I'll just write m for meters, 5 meters to the right in 2 seconds.\", 'Physics'], [\" So I'm curious about how much acceleration does a pilot or the pilot and the plane experience when they need to take off from an aircraft carrier. So I looked up a few statistics on the internet. This right here is a picture of an FA-18 Hornet right over here. It has a take-off speed of 260 kilometers per hour. If we want that to be a velocity, 260 kilometers per hour in this direction. And once again, I'm going to use the convention that the direction of the vector is implicit. Positive means going in the direction of takeoff. Negative would mean going the other way. My initial velocity go a certain number of kilometers in an hour or a second, I should be able to go a lot of many, many more meters in that same amount of time. And that's why we're multiplying by 1,000. But you here? It's going to be our final velocity plus our initial velocity over 2. It's just the average of the initial and final. And have change in time is equal to change in velocity divided by acceleration. So what's the change in velocity? Change in velocity. So this is going to be change in velocity divided by acceleration. Change in velocity is the same thing as a plus b times a minus b. And so this is equal to, and you can multiply it out if, and you can review in our algebra playlist how to multiply out two binomials like this. But this numerator right over here, I'll get right in blue, is going to be equal to our final velocity squared minus our initial velocity squared. This is a difference of squares, you can factor it the scalar version. And really we are thinking only in the scalar, we're thinking about the magnitudes of all of these things for the sake of this video. We're only dealing in one dimension. But sometimes you'll see it written like this. Sometimes you'll multiply both sides times the 2A and you'll get something like this where you have 2 times the, really the magnitude of the acceleration times the magnitude of the displacement which is the same thing as the distance is equal 80 meters times 80 meters is going to be equal to our final velocity squared. What's our final velocity 72 meters per second? So 72 meters per second squared minus our initial velocity. So our initial velocity in this situation is just zero. So this is going to be minus zero squared, which is just going to be zero. So we don't even have to write it down. And so to get meters per second squared, which is cool because that's what acceleration should be in. And so let's just get the calculator out to calculate this exact acceleration. So we have to take, oh sorry, this is 72 squared. Let me write that down. So an analogy for how the pilot would feel is when he's, if this is the chair right here, that his pilot's chair, that he's in, so this is the chair and he laying down on the beach or something like that. So it's very, very, very interesting, I guess, idea, at least to me. Now the other question that we can ask ourselves is how long will it take to get catapulted off of this carrier? And if he's accelerating at 33 meters per second squared, if he's accelerating at 33 meters per second squared, how long would it take him to go from zero to 72 meters per second?\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say we're going to shoot some object into the air at an angle. Let's say its speed is s, and the angle at which we shoot at the angle above the horizontal is theta. What I want to do in this video is figure out how far this object is going to travel as a function of the angle. And as a function of the speed, but we're going to assume that we're given the speed, that that's a bit of a constant. So if this is the ground right here. Once again, the magnitude of the vector is s, so you can imagine that the length of this arrow is s, and this angle right here is theta. This angle right here is theta. And to break it down into its horizontal and vertical components, we And to figure it out, you literally use our basic trig ratios. So we have a right triangle. This is a hypotenuse. And we can write down soka toa up here. Soka toa. Let me write it down in yellow. So hypotenuse. And our hypotenuse is the speed s. And so if we want to solve for our vertical velocity or the vertical component of our velocity, we multiply both sides of this equation by s. So you get s sine of theta is equal to the vertical component of our velocity. S sine of theta. And now for the horizontal component, we do the same thing\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video, I told you that we would figure out the final velocity of when this thing lands. So let's do that. I forgot to do it in the last video. So let's figure out the final velocity, the vertical and the horizontal components of that final velocity, and then we can reconstruct the total final velocity. So the horizontal component is easy because we already know that the horizontal component of its velocity is this value right over here, which we, this 30 cosine of 80 degrees, and that's not going to change at any point in time. Now we know what the change in time is. We know it is, well I'll just write down, times our time. And what is our change in velocity? Well our change in velocity is our final vertical. It's a vertical component. I didn't kind of mark it up here properly. It's equal to 29.54 meters per second plus 9.8 plus, I should say direction. And the horizontal component of our velocity we know hadn't changed the entire time. This is just straight from the Pythagorean theorem over the adjacent is equal to 29.03 over 5.21. Or that theta is equal to the inverse tangent or the arc tangent of 29.03 over 5.21. And that gives us, we take the inverse tangent of 29.03 divided by 2.\", 'Physics'], [\" We learned several videos ago that if I had an infinite, uniformly charged plane, let me draw one right here. And I won't draw it infinite, and I'll tell you why in a second. That if we had an infinite, uniformly charged plane. So with that said, let's see if we can figure out some of the properties of the voltage and how the voltage relates to the charge. If we were to the center assuming that they're reasonably, unless they say that they're D apart. Assuming that D isn't too big, near the center we're going to have a constant electric field. For example, this green one the relationship between the voltage across these two plates and the area and maybe the distance between the two plates. So we know that the electric field generated by any one of these charged plates, let's say for this, I'll do it in the blue of this color. So for the bottom plate right here, what the total electric field is going to be 4k pi q over A. So now we know the exact strength of the electric field. Let's see if we can figure out the voltage difference between this point. Let me draw it in the color that you can see between this point and this point. And what was has a way to move, if we have air here, maybe it's very, or if we have a vacuum here, it might be difficult or impossible for it to move up here. But maybe if we were to connect a wire that where the charges could freely conduct, then it will move and the voltage is kind of how badly does it want to move, you can almost view it as electrical pressure. And maybe I'll do a whole video on trying to get an intuitive understanding of voltage. Because that really is probably the most important thing electric field. Because we're always going to have to be going against the electric fields. We have to apply an equal and opposite force. So the force that is going to be the electric field. So so far this just generates us force. Coulomb times electric field, charge times. Right, that's just the units. So what does that equal? So the voltage difference, so we could say, you know, change in voltage. The voltage difference is equal to the electric field, which we know is constant, 4k definitely a constant. And if we assume that the distance between the plates don't change, then what we see is that there's a proportional difference between the voltage and the amount of charge in the combined charge in the plates. And that's interesting because before doing this, maybe it was, maybe a voltage is somehow proportional to the square of plates and I know it's configuration, I know how much charge there is. And this is called capacitance. And the units for capacitance is called the FARRAD. And if you become an electrical engineer or you even take a couple of electrical engineering courses, you'll become very familiar with this. And one other thing to point out, this term right here, just so you know a little bit of terminology. This term right here, this 1 over 4 k pi, 1 over 4 k pi,\", 'Physics'], [\" So where I left off we had this infinite plate, it's just an infinite plane, and it's a charge plate with a charge density sigma. And what we did is we said, okay, well we're taking this point up here that's h units above the surface of our charge plate field because we realize that all the x's cancel out anyway. The total electric field at that point, h units above the surface of the plane. So let's the y component of that electric field? We figured out it was this. So now what we're going to do is take the integral. So the total electric field from the plate, so the total electric field is going to be the integral from our, that's a really ugly looking integral, from a radius of zero to a, oh whoops, I didn't want to write that just yet. So let's take the k. I'm going to leave the two there and you'll see y in a second, but I'm going to take all the other constants out that we're not integrating across. So it's equal to k, h, pi sigma, pi sigma times the integral from this is a constant, so it equals 2r. Or we could say du is equal to 2r dr. And so if we're trying to 2 over, we could say, you know, minus 1 half, that's the same thing as over the square root of h squared plus r? What happens when we evaluate r at infinity? Well, the square root of infinity is still infinity and one over infinity is zero. So this expression get here, is 2k pi sigma. So that's the end of a lot of levels. First of all, what would we even do here? We might have gotten lost in the math., the field, you know, and I put some distance H above that field, you know, above that, I keep mixing up words, above that plate, it doesn't matter what that H is. I could be here, I could be here, I could be here. At all of those points, the field has the exact same strength or the net electrostatic force on a test charge at those points has\", 'Physics'], [\" Well, we've spent many videos talking about, you know, electric electrostatic fields and the potential on a charge or the potential energy of a charge when it's in one place. But let's see what happens where given a potential, what happens when we actually allow the charge to move? And this will probably be a lot more interesting to you because you'll learn how much of the modern world'll, you know, and that's why we call everything volts and voltage and all of that. But it's this magical thing that even as one side loses charge to the other side, that the actual, the voltage or the potential between the two sides actually remains constant. That's the magic of a battery. So let's just assume that we have one of these magic instruments. You probably have one in your calculator or your cell phone. And let's see that this wire is an ideal conductor, that charge can flow freely without being impeded. This thing right here, this scratchy line, this is a resistor. And this is something that will actually impede the charge. It'll keep it from the charge from going as fast as possible. And then, of course, out here, this is a perfect conductor again. Now, which way will the charge current? Well, current, so I will actually tell you what is current. Just remember, even though people say that the current and most textbooks do this and if you become electrical engineer, people will also say that the current is flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, the actual flowing of things actually occurs from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. It's not like somehow start bumping into things. They start bumping into the other electrons in this material. So this is the resistor right here. They start bumping into the other electrons in this material. They bump into the atoms and the molecules in this material. And in the process, the electrons essentially slow down. They're bumping into things. So essentially, the more things that there are to bump into, or the less base there are for the electrons to terminals, then the electrons that are sitting here, these electrons want to really badly get here. And if the voltage even higher, these electrons want to get there even more badly. So before people understood that voltage was just a potential difference, they would actually call this desire of the electrons to get from here to here as the electromotive force. But what we, right, so the current here is lower, right? Current is really just the rate of at which the charge is traveling, right? So if the current is lower here and the current was higher here, we would essentially end up having a buildup of charge someplace here a resistor actually is temperature increases, then its particles and its molecules are moving around more. They have higher average kinetic energy. And then it's even more likely that electrons will bump into them. So actually the resistance increases with temperature. But if we assume at a constant law, V equals IR. Voltage is 16 volts. And it equals the current times the resistance times 8 ohms. So the current is equal to 16 volts divided by 8 ohms, which is equal to 2. And this is the 2 amperes.\", 'Physics'], [\" Before we move on, I want to clarify something that I've inadvertently done. I think I was not exact with some of the terminology I use. So I want to highlight the difference between two things that I've used almost interchangeably up to this point, but now that we are about to embark on learning what voltage have an infinite uniformly charged plate so that we don't have to do calculus. We can have a uniform electric field. Let's say that this is the plate. Let's say I'm going to make it vertical just so we get a little bit of in 2 meters. I want to bring it in 2 meters so it's 1 meter away. So what is the electric or electrical potential energy difference between the particle at this point and at this point? Well the electrical potential energy difference is the amount of work particle is equal to the electric field times the charge, times the charge, which is equal to, I just defined the electric field as being three newtons per coulomb, sorry, three newtons per coulomb, times two coulombs, it equals six newtons. So just let go, it would start accelerating in this direction and a lot of that energy would be converted to kinetic energy, but we get to this point, right? So we could also say that the electric potential energy at this point right here is 12 joules higher than the electric potential energy at this point. Now that's potential energy. What is electric potential? Well, electric potential difference between this point and this point. So it was the distinction. Electric potential energy was associated with a particle. How much energy? How much more energy did the particle have here than here? When we say electric potential because we essentially divide by the size of the particle, it essentially is independent of the size of the particle. It actually just depends on our position knowing what the potential, the gravitational potential is at any point without having to care about the mass, what we would divide by the mass and it would be the acceleration of gravity timeside. Ignore that if it confused you. So what is useful about voltage? It's always regardless of how small or big or actually positive or negative a charge is, what the difference in potential energy would be if we're at two different points. So electric potential, we're comparing\", 'Physics'], [\" When you look at footage or photographs of astronauts in space, it doesn't look like there's any gravity at work here. Everything is not falling in down in one direction. In fact, it's not even clear what up or down is. Everything just floats around. If I were to push off of this wall, I would just float in that direction. So surface of the Earth, it's not going to change are that dramatically, especially in terms of percentage. So when you look at it this way, it seems pretty clear that the force of gravity for someone who is in space, only a few hundred miles above the Earth, should not be that different than the force of gravity for someone who is on the surface bit faster, it might go a little bit further, but it'll eventually fall back to the earth. Let's try to propel it a little bit faster than that. Then it'll still fall to the earth. Let's propel it even faster than that. Well, then it's still eventually going to fall to the earth. I think you might see where this going. Let's go even faster than that. So if we go curving its path. And if it's going fast enough, if the projectile or whatever object we're talking about is going fast enough, it'll just keep going round and round the earth. And since there is almost pretty much for most purposes, no air at, if you go high enough, especially the altitude that the space The influence of gravity, actually on some level, it just keeps going. It might become unnoticeably small at some point, but definitely if you're only a couple of hundred miles up in the air, there is definitely gravity there. It's just there in orbit. They're going fast enough. So if they just keep falling, they're never going to hit the earth. And if you want to simulate gravity, and this is actually how NASA does simulate gravity, is that they will put people in a plane and they call it the vomit rocket.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. In the last video, I showed you, or hopefully I did show you, that if I apply a force of F to an initially stationary object with mass m, and I apply that force for distance d, that force times distance, the force times the distance that I'm pushing the object is equal to 1 half mv squared, where m say the mass was, I don't know, let's say this was a 5 kilogram object and it's moving at 7 meters per second. So I would say the kinetic energy of this object is going to be 5 1 half times the mass times 5 times 7 squared times velocity squared. to change. Invert. Let's say I have a different situation, and we're on this planet. We're not in deep space. And I have a mass of m. And I were to apply a force. So moving because you would actually have to apply a force slightly larger than the acceleration of gravity just to get the object moving. But let's say that the object is already a constant velocity. Let's say it's an elevator. And it is just going up with a constant velocity. And let's say the mass of the elevator is, I don't know, 10 velocity. I think I said that two times. So we know that this upward force is equal to the force of gravity. So this is, at least in magnitude, and the opposite direction. So this is, this is mg. So what's m? M is 10 kilograms times the acceleration of gravity. Let's say that's 9.8 meters per second squared. I'm not writing the units here, the energy work had to be put into the object to get it to this, in the case of gravitational potential energy, work had to be put into the object to get it to this, which is the height. So it's approximately equal to 100 Newton meters, which is the same thing as 100 joules. Fair enough. And what did we know about this?\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. At the end of the last video, I left you with a bit of a question. We had a situation where we had a one kilogram object. See, this is the one kilogram object, which I have drawn neater in this video. This is one kilogram. And we're on Earth, and it is, and I need to mention that because gravity is different from planet to planet. But as I mentioned, I'm holding it, let's say I'm holding it 10 meters Well the block obviously will start falling and not only falling it will start accelerating to the ground at 10 meters per second squared roughly. And right before it hits the ground, let me draw that in brown for ground. Right before the object hits the ground or actually right when it hits that? Well what's the formula for kinetic energy? And we solved it two videos ago and hopefully it shouldn't be too much of a mystery to you. It's something good to memorize but it's also good to know how we got it and go back to videos if you forgot. So kinetic energy, so first we know that all the potential energy was that, or hopefully you could have solved that problem just using your kinematics formula. So what's the whole point of introducing these concepts of energy? And I will now show you. So let's say they have the same 1 kilogram object up here, and it's 10 meters in the air, but I'm going to change things a little bit. I'm going to change things a little bit. So let me see if I can competently erase all of this. Nope, that's not what I wanted to do. and then start sliding. so I'll sort of solve for it, 14.1 meters per second. Instead of going straight down, now it's going to be going in the horizontal to the right. And the reason why I said it was ISIS, because I wanted it to be frictionless, and I didn't want any energy lost to heat or anything like that. Anyway, say, okay, Sal, that's kind of interesting, and you kind of got the same number, then for the velocity, then if I just drop the object straight down, and that's interesting, system? Well, the potential energy is 100 and the kinetic energy is zero because it's stationary. I haven't dropped it yet. I haven't let go of it yet. So it's just stationary. So the initial energy is going to be equal to 100 joules. That's because this is zero and this is 100. So the initial energy is 100 joules. At sides by 2. You get v squared is equal to 100. The velocity is 10 meters per second along this crazy icy slide. And that is something that I would have challenged you to solve using traditional kinematics formulas, especially considering that we don't know really much about the surface of this slide.\", 'Physics'], [\" Before we move on, I just wanted to make sure you understood that last point I made at the end of that last video. We said that the pressure kind of inputting into this, we could view this cup with a hole and it is essentially a pipe where the v1 squared over 2 is equal to the output pressure plus rho g h2 plus the whole, at the right side of the whole, plus the kinetic energy PV2, the kinetic energy term, because this actually doesn't add up completely the kinetic energy because we manipulated it. And I just wanted to really make the point that this is definitely zero. I think that is clear to you because we have a vacuum up here, so the can imagine if this is the hole, let's say that's the opening of the hole, and I have some water particles or some fluid particles. Let's say that these are the atoms. These are the atoms. We're saying innately at any point, let's say at this, sure, there is a pressure at this point that's equal to rho gh. But this is P2. How much pressure I'm exerting on this end of the hole?\", 'Physics'], [\" So where we left off we had this canister because it had a closed top and had a vacuum above the fluid. And the fluid on top had a big marker right now. The fluid on top had an area of A1 and I poked a little hole with a super small area A2. And I said that area of A2 is so small it's 1 1,000th of area 1. And then we used the continuity equation. We said, well, the velocity, the rate at which the top of the surface moves down is equal to 1,000th of the velocity of the liquid spurting out of this little hole. So now with that we actually have the three variables for kind of the right hand side, or sorry the left hand side of Bernoulli's equation, and what are the variables on the left hand side telling us actually what is the external pressure at that hole, right? How much, when we did the derivation, we were saying how much work, this was kind of the work term, although we played around with it a little bit, right? But if we look at the water that's burning out of the hole, it's to the input to the pipe. You can view this as a pipe. I could redraw that cup as this. I could redraw it as a pipe that looks like the... Let me undo that. It has a big hole on the top and it goes down some level is zero, plus what is h2? Well, this is h2 right here, which we said is zero. We determined that the hole was poked at height zero. So surface area, then it becomes really insignificant. So we can ignore this term because it just makes things complicated. And we're assuming this is a really, really large number. If this whole is much smaller than the surface area of the fluid, and we can ignore this term,\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video we figured out that if we had a proton coming into the right at a velocity of 6 times 10 to the 7th meters per second, so the magnitude of velocity is 1 5th the speed of light. And if it were to cross this magnetic field we used this formula to figure out that the magnitude of the force on this proton, not protein, would be 4.8 times 10 to the staying in this plane. But the orientation does change within the plane. And because of that, because the orientation of velocity changes, the orientation of the force changes. So when the velocity is here, the force is perpendicular. So it acts as kind of a centripetal force. And so the particle will start moving in a circle. So let's see if we can break out our object in question times the magnitude of its velocity squared divided by the radius of the circle. In this case, this is the radius of the circle. And that's what we're going to try to solve for. And what do we know about the centripet force? What is causing the centripetal force? Well, it's the magnetic field. And we figure that out, right? This is going to be equal to this, which we figured out is going to be equal to, at least the magnitudes. The magnitude of this is equal to the magnitude of this, and that, the magnitude of its velocity squared divided by the force from the magnetic field, the centripetal force, 4.8 times 10 to the minus 12 newtons. And the radius should be in meters since everything is kind of in the standard SI units. And let's see if we can figure this out. Get our calculator. And this is where that constant function is useful again because what is the mass of a proton? Well, Let's see, hopefully we don't get something funky. There we go. And that's actually a pretty neat number. 1.25 meters. That's actually kind of a number that we can imagine. So if you have a proton going in this direction at 1-5th the speed of light through A, of different intensities and that's what forms the image. I won't go into that detail. Maybe one day I'll do a whole video on how TVs work. So that's one application of a magnetic field causing a beam of charged particles to curve. And then the other application, this is actually, one where it's actually useful to make the particle go in a circle, is these cyclotrons that you read about where they take these protons and they make them go in circles really, really fast and since they're at relativistic speeds as they move, different velocities, their masses change and all of that. But the basic idea is what we just learned. They move in circles. They move in circles because they're going through a magnetic field. But their radiuses are different because their charges and their velocities are going to be different. And actually some will move to the left, some will move said that the, at least when the proton is moving in this direction, that the net force would be downwards, right? But now, all of a sudden, if we reverse the charge, if we say we have a negative charge, it's the same magnitude, but it's negative because it's an electron, what happens? We're now, the force is now in this direction using the right hand rule, but it is negative. So really, it's going to be a positive force of the same magnitude in this direction. So if we have a proton,\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. I will now introduce you to the concept of momentum. And the letter for momentum is in physics, or at least in mechanics, is the letter P. P for momentum. And I assume that's because the letter M has already been used for mass, which is an even more fundamental idea. So P for momentum. So what is momentum? Well, you probably have a general idea of it. If you see a big guy running really fast, That's a good way of thinking about momentum. So momentum is mass times velocity. And since, well, let me, so how does it relate to everything we've been learning so far? So we know that force is equal to mass times acceleration, right? And what's acceleration? Well, acceleration is just changing velocity, right you think it means. An impulse is defined as force times time. And I just want to introduce this to you just in case you see it on an exam or whatever. I'll show you it's not a difficult concept. So force times change in time, or time if you assume time starts at time zero, but force times change in time is equal to impulse. I actually don't know, I should look up what letters they use for impulse. But another way of viewing impulse is if force times change in mind, let's do some momentum problems. Whoops. Invert colors. Okay. So let's say we have a car. Let's say it's a car. Let me do some more interesting colors. A car with a magenta bottom. And it is, let's see. The momentum of the car is going to be the mass times the car, mass of the car, well, the total momentum is going to be the mass of the car times the velocity of the car plus the mass of's just assume that there was nothing. This is a simple problem that we can do. So if we assume that, there would be no change in momentum because we're saying that there's no net forces acting on the system. And when I say system, force is change in momentum per time. So if you have no force in it, you have no change in momentum. So let's just solve, divide both sides of this by 3,000 and you get the new velocity is 3 meters per second. And that kind of makes sense.\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video I realized that I made a mistake near the end, but it's not a good one because I copied down the wrong number and then that led to the rest of the problem not having the right values. We figured out that the vertical component of our velocity earlier in the video is negative 26.03 meters per second. But then I somehow, something value right over here. So with is equal to the length of this vector right over here, which is the opposite side 26.03 over the length of this vector here, which is 5.21. Or we could say, if we take the inverse tangent of both sides of this,\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's learn a little bit about the dot product. The dot product, frankly, out of the two ways of multiplying vectors, I think is the easier one. So what does the dot product do? Well, I'll give you the definition and then I'll give you the intuition. So if I have two vectors, let's say vector A, vector A dot vector B. That's how I draw my arrows. I could draw my arrows like that. That is equal could view it as vector A, because you can, you know, multiplication is associative, you could switch the order. So this could also be written as the magnitude of vector A times cosine of theta times cosine of theta times, and I'll do it in color appropriate, times vector B. And this times isn't the dot product. I think you almost don't have to write it. It's like if you were to shine a light perpendicular to B, there was like a light source here and it just, the light show, it was straight down, it would be the shadow of A onto B, or you could almost think of it as the part of A that goes in the same direction of B. So this projection, they call it, and at least the way I get the intuition of what, is equal to the magnitude of A cosine of theta, which is exactly what we have up here in the definition of the dot product. So another way of visualizing the dot product is you can replace this term with the magnitude of the projection of A onto B, which is just this, times the magnitude of B. That's interesting. So what all the dot product of two vectors is, it says, well, let's just my force vector is 100 newtons. I'm making numbers up. 100 newtons. And let's say I pull it, I slide it to the right. So my would be 100 newtons times the cosine of 60 degrees and I'll tell you how much of that 100 newtons goes to the right. Or another way you could view it, if this is the force vector, and this down here is the distance vector, you could say that the total work you performed is equal to the force the dot product is useful. It applies to work. It actually calculates what component of what vector goes in the other direction. Now you can interpret it the other way. You could say this is the magnitude of A times B cosine of theta. And that's completely valid. And what's B cosine of theta? Well, if you took B cosine of theta, and you could work this out as an exercise for yourself, that's the amount of the magnitude of the B vector that's going in the A direction. You end up with just a scalar quantity. And why is that interesting? Well, it tells you how much do these vectors reinforce each other because you're taking their magnitudes, the parts of their magnitudes that go in the same direction and multiplying them. The cross product is actually almost the opposite. You're taking the orthogonal components, right? The difference was this was a sign of theta. And I don't want to mess you up this picture too much, but you should really\", 'Physics'], [\" So not only can a magnetic field exert some force on a moving charge, we're now going to learn that a moving charge or a current can actually create a magnetic field. So there is some type of symmetry here. And as we'll learn later when we learn our calculus and we do this in a slightly more rigorous way, how I do when I try to do rotations of solids in the calculus video. So the magnetic field it would go behind and in front and it goes like that. Or another way you could think about it is, if let's go down here, is on the left side of this wire, if you say that the wire is in the, your fingers are going to go in the direction of the magnetic field. So let me see if I can draw that. I will draw it in blue. So if this is my distributed over a wider and wider circumference. And actually, the formula I'm going to give you kind of has a taste for that. So the formula for the magnetic field, and it really is defined with a cross product and things like that. But for our purposes, we won't worry about circumference of a circle here, and that kind of makes sense, right? Because the magnetic field at that point is kind of a circle. The magnitude is equal at an equal radius around that wire. Now, what is this mu, this thing that looks like a u? Well, that's the permeability of the material that the wire is in. So the magnetic field is actually going to the magnitude of the magnetic field at this point is equal to, and we assume that the wire is going through air or a vacuum, the permeability of free space, that's just a constant, all that looks fancy, times the current times two amperes divided by two pi r, what's r? It's three the power sign divided by 3 pi. It equals 1.3 times 10 to the negative 7th. It's going to be Teslas. The magnetic field is going to be equal to 1.3 times 10 to the minus 7th Teslas. So it's a fairly weak magnetic field. And that's why you don't have metal objects being thrown around by the wires behind\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say I have some object that's traveling in a circular path just like this. And what I've drawn here is its velocity vector at different points along that path. And so this right over here is going to be V1, velocity vector 1, and this is going to be velocity vector 2, and this right over here is going to be velocity vector 3. And what we're going to assume in this3. But the magnitude of our position vectors are clearly the same. And I'm going to call the magnitude of our position vectors r. And that's just the radius of the circle. It's this distance right over here. So r is equal to the magnitude of r1, which is equal to the magnitude of r2, which is equal to the magnitude of r3., actually I want to do it from the center. So that is V1. Let me do the same thing for V2. So let me copy and paste it. That is V2. And then let me do it also for V3. So V3, I'll just get the vector part, I don't have to get the label. So copy and paste1. We'll call this A2, A2, and I'll call this A3. And I want to make sure that you get the analogy that's going on here. As we go around in this circle, the position vector, first they point out to the left, then the upper, up kind of in the, maybe 11 o'clock position, or I guess the top left, then to the top. A3, once again if you translate that, that is going towards the center. So all of these are actually center seeking vectors. And you see that right over here. These are actually centripetal acceleration vectors right over here. Here we're talking about just the magnitude of it. And we're going to assume that all of these have the same magnitude. So we're going to assume that our centripetal, they all have a magnitude that we'll call A sub C. So that's the magnitude, by your actual, the magnitude of your velocity or your speed. This is magnitude of velocity, not velocity. This is not a vector right over here. This is a scalar. So this is going to be the time to travel along that path. Now, the time to travel along this path is going to be the exact same amount of time it takes to travel along this path for the velocity vector. So this is for the position vector to travel like that. This is for the velocity vector to travel like that, for the position vector, is the same amount of time it takes the velocity vector to go like that. So we can set these two things equally each other. So we get, on this side, we get 1 4 2 pi r over v is equal to 1 4 2 pi v over the magnitude of our acceleration vector.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do in this video now that we have displacement as a function of time given constant acceleration and initial velocity, I want to plot displacement velocity, I should say final velocity and acceleration, all of those as functions of time. Just so that we really understand what's happening as the ball is going up and then down. So we do right over here will be my displacement versus time. So this axis right over here is going to be time, or maybe I could call this the change in time axis. Actually, let's just call it time. Let's just call it time. And then this axis right over here, I will call displacement. And so once again, I care about one second, two seconds, three seconds, and four seconds in time. And a velocity, I'm going to call this, this is going to be 10 meters per second. 10 meters per second, this is 20 meters per second. This will be negative 10 meters per second, and this will be negative 20 meters per second. And so all of this is time. But let's figure out displacement and velocity. So let me draw a little table here. Let me, so I'll do in one column, I will do change in time. Or you could sometimes, you could do that as time. Let's figure out what our final velocity is, or I should really see our current velocity second. So it is going to be 19.6 meters per second. And let me plot that over here. At time 0, it is going to be 19.6 meters per second. What is one second, our velocity is now half of what it was before. So we're now going 9.8 meters per second. Let me draw a line here. 9.8 have the object actually slowing down as it went up. Because if you would have gravity somehow accelerating it as it went up. But it's actually slowing it down. It's pulling it, it's accelerating it in the downwards direction. So that's why you have to have that negative right over there. That was our convention at the beginning of the last video. Up is positive, down is negative. So let's focus. So this part right over here 2, 9.8 meters per second squared times 2 seconds gives us 19.6 meters per second. So these just cancel out. So we get our velocity is now 0. So after 2 seconds, our velocity is now 0. Let me air. Now let's go to 3 seconds. So after 3 seconds, our velocity is now, it's 19.6 meters per second, minus 9.8 times 3. And we could do that in delta t, so this is three seconds. We're talking about when delta t, or change in time is three seconds, so that squared, so times nine. And that gives us 14.7 meters. So we're at 14.7 meters. So after three seconds, we're at 14.7 meters again. And so we're at the same. We are back on the ground. So if you were to plot its displacement, you would actually get a parabola, a downward opening parabola that looks something like this, doing my best to draw it relatively neatly. So I check into a better job than that. I'll do a dotted line. D velocity in blue. So right when we start, it has a positive velocity of 19.6 meters per second. So I'll draw a big vector like this, 19.6 meters per second. That's its velocity. Then after one second, it's 9.8 meters per second. So it's half of that. So then it's, maybe it would look something like this, 9.8 meters per second. Then at this peak right over here, it has a velocity of zero. Then as you go to three seconds, it has the magnitude of zero.\", 'Physics'], [\" What I want to do now is figure out what's the minimum speed that the car has to be at the top of this loop loop in order to stay on the track, in order to stay in the circular motion, in order to not fall down like this, and I think we can all appreciate that. That is the most difficult part of the loop loop, at least in the bottom half right over here. The track itself is actually what's providing the centripetal force to keep it going in a circle, but when you get what that minimum velocity would have to be up here at the top of the loop. So we know that the magnitude of your centripetal acceleration is going to be equal to your speed squared divided by the radius of the circle that you are going around. Now, at this point right over here at the top, which is going to be the hardest point, the magnitude of our get v squared is equal to a times r, and then you take the principal square root of both sides, you get v is equal to the principal square root of a times r. And then if we plug in these numbers, this velocity that we have to have in order to stay in this circle is going driving cars. We can convert 7.7 meters per second, 7.7 meters per second. If we want to say how many meters we go in an hour, well there's 3600 seconds in an hour. And if you want to convert that traction with the road, the car might slip and might not be able to actually maintain its speed. So you definitely want to be a good bit, you might want your speed to be a good bit larger than this in order to keep a nice margin of safety in order, especially have traction with the actual loop and to be able to maintain your speed. Now what I want to do in the next video is actually\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's imagine that instead of having two charges, we just have one charge by itself sitting in a vacuum, sitting in space. So let's have this charge here. And let's say it's charge is, I don't know, it's Q. That's some number, you know, but whatever it is, that's this charge. And I want to know if I were to place another charge close to this Q, somehow, you know, somehow within its, you could call it sphere of So Coulomb's law told us that the force between two charges is going to equal to Coulomb's constant times, and in this case the first charge is big Q. And let's say that the second, whatever, notional charge that I eventually put in this field is small Q. And then you divide by the distance between them. Sometimes it's called R because you can kind of view the distance this is the definition of the electric field. This is the electric field at the point D1. And if we wanted a more general definition of the electric field, it'll just make this a general variable. So instead of having a particular distance, we'll is the electric field there? Well, the electric field at that point is going to be equal to what? And it's also a vector quantity, right? Because we're dividing a vector quantity by a scalar quantity charge. So the electric field at that point is going to be equal to Coulomb's constant, which is 9 times 10 to the ninth times the charge generating the field times 1 times 10 to the minus 6 in the Coulombs. And then we are two meters away, so 2 squared. So that equals a c, 9 times 10 to the negative 6 coulomb, this is one coulomb, in which direction will the force be? Well, they're both positive, so the force is going to be outwards. So let's take this notion and see if we was here it would go out like that. I think you would get the picture. At any point a positive test charge would just go straight out away from our charge Q. And to some degree one measure of actually, and these are called electric field lines. And one measure of how strong the any point is you could have, you say, okay, if that's my charge Q, you could say, well, really close the field is strong. So at this point, you know, the vector is, the Newton's percolum is that strong, you know, that strong, that strong, that strong. And you have to, we're it gets closer to the negative one, it'll speed up again and then that would be its path. And similarly, if there was a positive test charge here, its path is the force acting on an electron placed in an external electric field where the electric field is, they're saying it is 100 newtons per coulomb at that point, wherever the electron is. So the force\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's say that when I have some object and when it's outside of water, it's weight is, so weight outside of water is, I don't know, 10 Newtons. And let's say with an I submerged in water, I put it on a weighing machine in water. It's weight, so is equal to 10 minus 2 is equal to 8. That's how to the negative four equals 8. And this might seem like a very small volume, but just keep in mind, in a meter cubed, you have, let's see, you have 27 square feet, right? You have 27 square of balsa wood. And what I want to know is if I put that, so let me draw the water. That's the water. And I have some big cube of balsa wood, which I'll do in brown. So I have that big cube of balsa wood and the water should go on top of it just so you see that it's submerged in the water. All right. I want to know what percentage of the cube goes below the Volume of displaced water. But that's also, well, it's the volume of displaced water and it's the volume of the cube that's been submerged. The part of the cube that's submerged, that's volume that's also equal to the amount of water displaced, right? So we can say that's the volume of the block submerged, which is the same thing, remember, as the volume of the water displaced times the density of water times gravity, remember this is the density of water. So remember, the buoyant we divide both sides by the volume of the balsa wood? You get, let's put this over here. So you get, well let's divide boats, well I'm just rearranging this equation. I think you'll figure it out. We can get, divide both sides by that. You get the volume submerged, divided by the volume of the balsa wood, right? I just divided both sides by VB and divide, and switch sides is equal to, and unless, is equal to,\", 'Physics'], [\" We know a little bit about magnets now. Let's see if we can study it further and learn a little bit about magnetic field and actually the effects that they have on moving charges. And that's actually really how we define magnetic fields. So first of all, with any field, it's good to have a way to visualize it. With say, let me draw it in a different color. Let's say I put the compass here. Field, well that's not where I wanted to do now. But in classical electricity and magnetism, they're kind of a different force. And the main difference, although this field lines, you can kind of view them as being similar, is that magnetic forces always come in dipoles while you could have electrostatic forces that are monop But anyway, back to what I'll call the basic physics. So, if I define a magnetic field as B, so B is a vector and it's a magnetic field, we know that the force on a moving charge could be an So for example, if the velocity is exactly perpendicular to the magnetic field, then we'll actually get a number. If they're parallel, then the magnetic field has no impact on the charge. So that's one kind of interesting thing. And then the other interesting thing is, when you take the cross product of two vectors, and then we could put, you know, if we wanted the actual force vector, we could just multiply this times the vector we get using the right-hand rule. We'll do that in a second. But anyway, we're just focused on units. Sign of theta has no units, so we can ignore it for this discussion. We I just want you to sit and think about it for a second. Even though, in life, we're used to dealing with magnets as we have these magnets, and they're fundamentally maybe different than what, at least we imagine, electricity to be. But the magnitude of, or actually the units\", 'Physics'], [\" Let's do another example where we're projecting something and it lands at a different level. And we'll also figure out some other interesting things. We'll figure out what the actual velocity vector is when it's landing. So both its magnitude and its direction. So let's do a situation. So let's say we're launching something from ground level and we're going to launch it at a pretty steep angle over here. So let's say we launch it with an angle of, let me just, let's say it this right over here is 2 meters. So we just want to know how far along the landing do we land. So like we did before, we want to break this vector into its horizontal and vertical components. And I'm going to go a little bit faster in this video because hopefully we're getting the knack for this type of thing. So our velocity in the vertical or our vertical component of our velocity is going to be equal to the initial velocity times time plus acceleration, let me write times change in times, that's more technically, that's technically more correct, plus acceleration times change in time squared over two. Now in our situation, we know what our initial velocity negative 9.8 divided by 2. So it's negative, I'll do that same green color, 4. That's not the negative times the negative is a positive. So it's plus 4 times positive 4.9 times, I shouldn't have jumped so fast to get rid of the negative. So it's going to be minus 4 times a, which is negative 4.9, times c, which is negative 10. So just a times c, negative 4.9 times negative 10. So let me just write negative 4.9 times negative 10. These two when you take the product is positive 49. So times 49, and I our velocity in the horizontal direction. And it's a constant velocity, so it's the same thing as our average velocity in the horizontal direction, times the change in time. Well, the change in time is, so I'll just write it out, times our change in time. So this is going to be equal Let me write this down. So we have a horizontal displacement. We have a horizontal displacement of 29.53 meters. And we have a vertical displacement of plus 10 meters. We have a vertical displacement of positive 10 meters. And so what is our total displacement? What is our total displacement going to be? of 10 squared is just 100 plus 29. I could even use, well I could use all of this information so I don't even lose some precision. I could say second answer. That literally means the previous answer which is at 29.53 squared gives us a total displacement of 31.18 over 31.8. 10 over 31.18, I should say. So let's once again get the calculator out to figure out that value. So I'm gonna take the inverse sign. Once again, this is the same thing as the arc sign. This says, give me the angle that when I take its sign, I get this value right over here. So the inverse sign of 10 divided by our pre-order\", 'Physics'], [\" All the problems we've been dealing with so far have had have essentially been happening in one dimension You could go forward or back so you could go forward or back or right or left or you could go up or Down what I want to start to talk about in this video is what happens when we extend that to two dimensions or we can even just extend what we're doing in this video three or four Really an, for vector A, that you get the length right and you get the direction right, where you actually draw it doesn't matter. So this could be vector A, this could also be vector A. Notice it has the same length and it has the same direction. This is also vector A. I could draw vector A up here. It does not matter. I could draw vector A up there. I could draw vector B. I could draw vector B over here. It then vector B would look something like this. It would look something like this. And then if you go from the tail of A, all the way to the head of the magenta vector. And the magenta vector starts at the head of the green vector and then finishes, I could draw it like this. X vertical. And so what you see is that you can express this vector x. You can express this vector x. Let me do the same colors. You can express this vector x as the sum of its horizontal and its vertical components. As the sum of its horizontal and its vertical components. Now we're going to see over and over again that this is's say that this right over here is the positive y axis going in the vertical direction. This right over here is the positive x axis going in the horizontal direction. And to specify this vector's direction, I will give this angle right over here. And I'm going to give a very peculiar angle, but I picked this for specific reasons, just so things work out neatly in the end. And I'm going to give it in degrees. It's 36 vertical component. And we can sometimes call this. We could call the vertical component over here a sub y so that it's moving in the y direction. And we could call this horizontal component a sub x. And what I want to do is I want to figure out the magnitude of a sub y and a sub x. So how do we do that? Well, the way we drew this, I've essentially set up a right triangle for us. This is a right triangle. We know the length of this triangle. The length be equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse. The opposite side of the angle is the magnitude of our y component over the magnitude of the hypotenuse over the length over here, which we know is going to be equal to the magnitude of our y component over the magnitude of the hypotenuse over the length over here, which we know is going to be equal to the hypotenuse I should say, which has a length of five. Once again, we multiply both sides by five and we get five times the cosine of 36.8, 99 degrees is equal to the magnitude of our x component. So let's figure out what these are. Let me get the calculator out. Let me get my trust DTI-85 out. I want to make sure it's in degree 4. So what we see here is a situation where we have, this is a classic 3, 4, 5 Pythagorean triangle. The magnitude of our horizontal component is 4. The magnitude of our vertical component, the magnitude of our vertical component right over here is equal to 3. And once again, you might say, Sal, you know, why are we going through all of this trouble? And we'll see in the next video is if we say something has a velocity.\", 'Physics'], [\" Welcome back. We will now do a momentum problem in two dimensions. So let's see what we have here. So we have this ball A and we can maybe even think of it as this and maybe what's going on on the surface of a pool table. We have ball A and it's moving with its 10 kilograms. So these numbers are the mass of the balls. This is a 10 kilogram ball and it's moving to the right at 3 meters per second. And then it hits this ball B which is a 5 kilogram ball. And then key here is that there's just really one more step when you're working on it in two dimensions, or really three dimensions, or an arbitrary number of dimensions. When we did one dimension, you made sure that momentum was conserved in that one dimension. So when you do two dimensions, what you do is you figure out the initial momentum in each of the dimensions. So you break it up into the x and y components. And then you say the final momentum of both objects are going to equal the initial x momentum and are going to equal the the x direction. So the momentum in the x direction is 30 kilogram meters per second, right? Mass times velocity kilogram meters per second. And what's the initial momentum in the y direction? Well, b isn't moving at all, so it has no momentum in any direction. And a, all of a's movement is in's laws. This is just our trigonometry and we can write out our sokotoa again. So kotoa and I reassure you this is the hardest part of any of these multi-dimensional physics problems which really are just trig problems. So if we want to figure out second. And what is the velocity of A in the y direction? Well, hopefully this is second nature to you as well, but this is opposite over hypotenuse is equal to the sine of 30. So V A in the y direction is equal to 2 times the sine of going opposite, it's positive. It's one meters per second is velocity times the mass. So 10 times one is 10 kilogram meter per second. So now let's figure out B. Let's do the y direction first because they add up to zero. So we know that, I'm gonna switch colors. We know that the momentum of, and this is after the collision, the momentum of A in the y direction, that's its mass, is equal to 10. 10 is its momentum. So the velocity of the y direction of b must be 2 meters per second. So there we go. We figured out b's velocity and so let's say this is b's velocity vector in the y direction is, and 12.7, 12.7 kilograms meters per second, and we know the momentum so we just divide by the mass and we get its velocity in the x direction. So 12.7 divided by five, so the velocity of B\", 'Physics'], [\" So we just finished hopefully getting intuition for why, you know, my initial pressure times my initial volume divided by my initial temperature is going to equal, you know, if I change the volume or the pressure or the temperature or some combination of all of them is going to equal my new pressure times my new volume degrees Celsius is boiling. And that's how they rated it. And of course you could be colder than the freezing of water and you'd have to go negative in that situation. Fahrenheit, I'm actually not sure how far it I need to look that up in Wikipedia or that might be something for you to do and tell me how it came out. You know, I think boiling of water in Fahrenheit in the Celsius scale, is a bit arbitrary. They pick the freezing of water. So later on, people figured out that there is an absolute point to start at. And that absolute point to start at is the temperature at which a molecule or an atom the same thing as minus 273 degrees Celsius. So nowhere in the universe, at least that I'm aware of, is have kinetic energy, I can make the statement that this has five times the energy of this, something that's at five Kelvin versus one Kelvin. So that whole long explanation about Kelvin, that's just to of the earlier videos I think I said Newton's per meter cube. Newton's per meter squared. I just want in Celsius, you just add 273 to it. Does that make sense? Because think of it this way. If you're at zero degrees Celsius, you're at, you're already a 2 here, times V2, times 20, divided by our new temperature, 323. Let's see, we could simplify this. We could take two zeros off of here, take two zeros off of here, and then we could take a 3 out of here and take a 3 out of here, and we're left with 100, right? This is equal to 100, right? That was 3000 divided by, I'm sorry, that's 30,000 divided by 300.\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video, we talked about the idea that if I start with some type of a string there, and if I were to take the left end of the string, I could just as equally have done the right, but if I take the left end of the string and jerk it up, then all the way down and then back to its resting position, it'll generate this disturbance in the string. And the disturbance might initially look like this after I've done that jerking up and down once, and that disturbance is going to propagate down the string. It's going to move down the string like this. It would look something like this. It would look something, doing my best to draw it neatly. It might look something like this. Where once again the perturbations are going toward the disturbances are going to move to the right. They're going to move to the right with some velocity. And what I want to do in this video is really focus on this type of wave. This type of wave height. Wave height they normally refer to from the bottom, from the trough of a wave to its peak. Amplitude we're talking about from the resting position to its peak. So let me label peak. I think you know what peak means. Peak is the highest point on the wave. That's the peak and that's the trough. If you long for each cycle? Or you might say, how long for each period? We're saying this is periodic. Each period is each repetition of the wave. So this idea of So how many cycles per second, that's the inverse of periods. So period, the, this is a hertz. So I could have also written this down as 10 hertz, which you've probably heard before. 10 hertz just means 10 cycles per second. If my frequency completing exactly one cycle. Or you could view it as a distance from one peak to another peak. That is also going to be the wavelength. Or you could view it as a distance from one trough to remember a period is how long does it take to complete one cycle, one complete up, down same thing as the frequency. So this could be, I could rewrite this as wavelength. And so actually I should be clear here. The notation for wavelength tends to be the Greek letter lambda. So we could say velocity is equal to wavelength over period, which is the same thing as 20 hertz. So literally, if you were only to see this, if you had a little window where you're only able to observe this part of your wave distance per cycle. So in this situation, if this is moving to the right at 100 meters per second, and this frequency, I see this moving up and down 20 times in a second,\", 'Physics'], [\" In the last video, we figured out the absolute minimum speed in order to stay on the circular path right over here, especially near the top, was 27.6 kmh. What I want to do in this video is I just want to clip out the parts where he's actually on the loop-to-loop, and I want to actually figure out his average velocity. So I'm going to use the video editor right here to time how long it takes to complete the do the loop. So that's one second and then two seconds, two and 14 30th. So almost two and a half seconds. So let's write that down. So the time, and this is all rough, because I'm approximating right over here, the time required to do the loop, the loop. So that is two and 14 over 32 and 14 over 30 seconds. Now let's get our calculator out to actually calculate that value. So we're going to have the distance is, let me clear this. So we have 12 pi meters divided by, let's write this per hour. So that's how many meters per hour divided by 1,000, which you can kind of see right over there. That is 55 kilometers per hour. And if you wanted to do it in miles, a rough approximation divided by 1.6, it's about 35 miles per hour, give or take, or 55 kilometers per hour.

I didn't hurt I didn't hurt the bird It's too far up anyways So I had to get rid of bird But then I also got allergies. Okay All right, so here's the edge right here. It's a little bit darker Okay, let's keep going. this part right here is blue. I'm just gonna draw a line. So I'm just gonna give this overall one shape first, even though there's a highlight. So tempting to just, so much easier to just go like this. Yeah, I'm just gonna move, pivot on your shoulders, on your elbow. You kind of want to get a little bit more edge. darker. I mean there's some highlight here too. Okay I don't want to use my electric hyzer again. I was just gonna make a mess. So this part needs to be darker. You're drawing some of those reflective lines. Yeah very really crooked right here. Okay, oh well. See, dark, dark, wavy line, maybe slightly darker here. I think you'll notice that it's kind, right? Sometimes you keep seeing little things. I'm always making fix that, I can fix that.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. For this video, I'm just going to show you a quick demonstration of this new woodless graphite pencil that I just got. And the brand is Coenor, which is very popular. And what these woodless pencils are, they're basically what it says they are, they're woodless pencils. They don't have the regular wood around them. It's just one stick of lead graphite Let's see it's in frame. This is the HB. You can see it's pretty light. I'm just going to shade as quickly as I can. I'm just kind of shading with these kind of wiggly shapes. It works well for any organic, especially the human figure. Let me see how's the 2B is a part of my favorite pencils. Favorite grade. I guess it's just nice soft softness but it's still a little bit hard enough the HP the HP I was getting some breakage maybe because it was just a little bit harder I don't know So let's make the turn my edge pencil a little bit darker so I can get that little hard edge and it. It's just like, whoa, that's not soft. So you can see that the strokes, if you compare this to that, it's really soft. But it's nice because you see this is what I love about soft pencils. You... Again, I'm getting the same feeling. There's this hard patches here and there. I'm not sure. I don't think it's my strokes. It's just... Could be the pencil. So you can see how much darker this thing goes. You see how dark that is? But in terms of softness, the 9B and the 4B, for this exercise, actually felt very similar. Usually with the 9B, when the Steelers is really soft and really, you can actually see the big difference between the 9B and a 4B. I can actually be a little bit rougher With this XP because I know it won't go that dark. So even if I push into it, you know, I won't mess up the giant too much Okay I'm gonna fill in some of these gaps that I wasn't able to do with the 2B too much I'm just gonna go to the 4B let's push that up a little bit and a little bit more shading just to fill in these darker areas right here and I'm actually looking at the camera image too just that way I can see like a\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's do a really important exercise and that's to draw some really simple bananas. So let's get started and talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let's draw this bunch of bananas here, but first of all, I'm just going to draw one because, you know, a lot of it just kind of repeating anyways, right? So as simple as it is, it's a really good exercise because even though with these simple shapes, there's a lot of complexity in there, you know, in terms of shading when you actually looking at a surface. Alright, so here's the stem. Okay, and then there's a little bit of line here because it's not like a cylinder. It's actually a slightly, you know, hard edge right here. So I'm just kind of outlined it slightly because we don't want to draw in too big of a line here because it's actually defined by the shading. So let's just go. So just by doing that, it gives this thing the whole form. So be a little bit darker because it's almost like casting a shadow in there. Right here's a little bit darker. Now so that we can see approximately where this banana is. So this one here is going to go right and just gonna dab it in real quick All right here we're gonna stuff, you know Those are kind of more detailed stuff. Alright, so let's work on this one so that we can kind of finish this one off I mean we might or might not do this one. It's just kind of like this Might not do that one. I don't know. It's so repetitive. Banana. It's a banana. Alright, so a gradation going on here. Okay, so this is darker here. Again, this is right here. So let's... And here's the shadow to bring that out. And this is kind of closer to the table. So that's why it's darker. And it's gonna fade off a little bit here. I might be able to use a stump on this one. This could be a case where a stump would actually work very well. Alright, so let's finish off the top here. Again, this is very messy, right? It's like, you know, there's a lot of little Cleaner and cleaner. Sorry, I don't have a lot of patience. One thing I can't stand in life is waiting in line. I'd rather not have it if I have the waiting line. But that's just me. So here are some more subtleties. You see how I can actually shade with this? Because the stump, if it's very light. I could have gone darker. I just remember the darker you go, the more time it usually and shadows and just basically lights and darks you know how that affects the drawing how it gives it weight so it's a little bit more in depth you know explanation for that kind of stuff this is more artistic it's what I mean by the artistic experience\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and thanks for joining me here once again. So for this video I will be doing another shading of a basic geometry shape and this time we're gonna do a cylinder. And this is a very important shape because it's rounded and as you know, most of the stuff, especially the human figure, it's all rounded shape. So we have to understand how light works on any kind of curved surface. So let's get started and I It's not perfect, but let's just go with it. For this oval, it could be a little bit tricky to draw. It was something you're not used to doing. So it's basically just a circle, right? And then I ask you, you know, squash it down. You just get narrower and more and more narrow. So you over a little bit. This is kind of like on the table, so I know where the light source is going to come up from. So let's say right around here. So basically if you draw a line down here like this, this is gonna be your darkest part. I know it's a little bit messy but I'm just trying to... I can smooth little bit. Okay. So now you can kind of feel it a little bit, right? Let me, let me accentuate this a little bit. Let's see the bottom. We can generally make it dark because, you know, there's usually a little gap there, right? So there's going to be a kind of a cast shadow. Okay, now the top. Now the top, I'm going to switch to my 2B. So we mean, yeah, completely dark. Because there's usually some kind of ambient light. So some light is bouncing back onto the surface. So I'm gonna make this look darker. Alright, so let me... Let me do the shadow, because it's actually pretty important. So to do the shadow, let's just fade it out. Let's not have to go all the way there. So I'm gonna make this dark. Okay. Just moving things out a little bit. So now with this shadow here, this is very dark, which is correct. And this part, now that this is dark, this whole area looks a little bit too light now, right? So there's gotta be some kind of reflective lighting around this area. So let's see. So you take this, where this is situated right here, this part is completely dark. So it's not gonna bounce much light back onto the cylinder. So you can make that a little bit darker, right? It just feels a little bit more solid. So that is not too shabby, all right? Okay, so let's, now if you want to go into a little bit more detail, let me see, real tedious. This is going to be some bounce light from here up back here. So that means this edge down here will be a little bit you have the terminator and then once you have the hottest spot, which is the highlight, then you know, everything else is just a gradation in between. All right, so, you know, just try it out, you know, it's pretty easy. Just go cylinder, put a light anywhere that you want.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's do some more perspective drawings and this time I'll show you how to do a circle in perspective. So let's get started and talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let's draw a circle in perspective. It's kind of like drawing like a tire or wheel in perspective. So in order to draw any kind of circles in perspective, we always have to kind of start out with the square. So I'm going to is a little bit squashed, it's not necessarily a square, so. Alright, so once we have this, right, now we have these corners right here, so we know the circle is not being here, so we know this is gonna be where it touches the outside of this box. So in order to do the curve here, like how do I do this curve, there's a real simple method, and it might be a little bit off, you know, almost like all the way to the edge here, right? And this one, and then that's two other points here. It's not right where the, where intersects, but it's a little bit on the outside of that. So just do two points right there. And then this point right here will be same as that. Okay, and then we're gonna repeat this for all these other grids. So here, so one can see how you know that space It's just basically connecting the dots once we get that and then you have a nice So it's a little bit squashed. You know, this should be a little bit taller than we were We would have a much nicer circle So that's the key right so in order to do just quickly Okay, I squashed again Find a center by doing an X and wear a box like this. So I can visualize it a little bit better. So these are vertical. And then all these lines, these perspective lines, meet up to one point and then all these lines are gonna meet up to another point. So that's why it's a two point perspective. But all we want is this little box right here. So let's say but just let me show you the, I guess, the more complicated ones first. All right, so now that's all divided up. Here's the center line again, just so I know where we are. So again, one here, one point, you do these grid lines. Obviously if these grid lines are off, it's going to be off. So basically that's how it works. So let's say we want to extend this. Let's say we want to make it into a tire. So I'm going to extend this to the box. So let's give it some volume. So now extend this is all vertical. So now we know this is the edge right here of trying a circle in perspective, but it's much more accurate. Now let me show you the easier way of doing it and it's a little bit, you see it's a little bit easier, but then you know again the trade-off is that it's not as accurate. So we're gonna start with the same thing, let's just do the top eyeballing Alright, so you kind of have to remember this shape right here this little you know kind of like a I guess you can slice a watermelon or Yeah, this kind of this give you kind of a rough idea of kind of just circling perspective. So either way kind of works, you know, you can do it this way, it's a little bit faster, you know, if you're drawing cars or whatever, because you don't want to, you don't want to measure that much, right?\", 'Art'], [\" Okay, this is waywelloutaway.com. So in this video, let me show you some basic exercises that you can do in order to improve your line quality. Now, whatever you draw a sketch is basically a series of lines and the way that you apply those lines will make all the difference in your drawing. So let me show you how most artists apply ease out and that will allow you to, you know, when you want to continue the line, you can, you know, you can't zoom in, just kind of able to lift off, you know, as you're going out. So this is actually pretty cool. I mean, you can just, you know, keep practicing this. here you can just talk on this. I mean, it's almost impossible to try to get it smoothed out because the minute you cross, this area gets darker. So by forcing you to do, follow these lines, it forces you to follow the direction. And only by following the same direction of these lines will you be a lift out. Come in, lift out. So this way you can do a nice line and it's always continuous. You can go wherever you want. Now let's say you want to make this a little bit darker and it's the same thing. You just kind of come in.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's do a drawing of bow fruit and I know it sounds really really boring But there's actually so much good stuff that you can get out of it and it's a really good exercise So I'll talk about all those important factors along the way. Alright, so let's try this bow of fruit. Let's see the first thing to do is to kind of match out Rough out the shape of the bow so we know how big things will be and let me see just let me up the grapes looks like it's starting right about in the middle and I'm just gonna block it in for now because there's a lot of obviously a lot of little each individual grape and Let's see how much detail I want to put in So I'm just gonna block it in Let's see banana What's up here? I'm gonna do this one here one, I can just go all the way through you know as if it's going through all the grapes. Don't try to draw the edges now. I'm keeping it real light so I can don't have to erase out as much later. And can always spend more time if you wanted to you know for a little details and things like that but Drawing this kind of stuff is actually really good for you and that's part of reason why you know a lot of art classes especially the beginner ones or even the advanced ones, you know, this? So when it is black and white it will be kind of darker. So judging from the value of this, the color of this orange, I don't know, it's almost middle gray. I think if you go, if you turn into black and white it's black and middle gray. So let's just go with that. And we just make it a little bit lighter than the apple, right you will lose that dimensionality. So that's why these kind of exercises are really good because there's just so many edges going in front and things coming forward and things like that. So you kind of have to play with that. Even if you make this Penhana 2 dark, it might be weird. It might look like they're run. So I'm gonna try to keep all the apple right here, right? This area is darker here. So I can actually start shading that. Shading the apple. And by shading the apple, this edge right here comes forward. So it gives you this edge for the banana. So let's do the grapes and this is where it can get a little bit messy so each individual one just kind to simplify it. Okay, and then sometimes it works. So let's see if I look, I just let me do a few more of these and I can look at it in the camera and I can see how well shade like this and then you know as I do the resin I can always bring back the highlights with the with bit of texturing just to give it a little bit more life. And I'll part of to do something to the background too because it's relatively boring when it's white and part of the exercises of doing seem kind of simple but it's actually a lot of play of shadowing and edges here and that's really one of the lessons that you're gonna take away from this. It's so important to shade the edges correctly and how you can create contrast by artificially making some edge darker and then either way a darker or lighter so that the edges pop out.\", 'Art'], [\" Everyone this is Wei and welcome back. Let's talk about one of the most important shading methods and that is cross-hatching So if you can learn how to draw you really need to know this so let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way Alright, so let's talk about cross-hatching and really this kind of shading method should be kind of like your primary Shading method and you know we can work out you know different ways of shading But in terms of the just in shading in general cross-hatching is really the way to go So by crosshatching you see how Let's do one more right there. You know you're able to create like a nice gradation Just by these simple lines. Now if I want to do a gradation, of course, you know, you can Just do this, right? You go dark and then just slowly lighter and lighter and lighter and that's I mean this works great too if it is, you know as long as you kind of cross a little bit and You can see the effect is very similar I know this is a little bit messier, but in general when you're working a larger drawing, you know this kind of stuff, you know, you need this kind of finer control and You know all these little messy lines is pretty much gonna go away So you actually don't have to worry too much about it. So let's do another example Let's say there's something really simple. Let's just this a lot quicker, right? I mean, you can just go darker and then just kind of fade it out here, fade it out a little bit, maybe a slight crosshatching. So you can see this, I mean, obviously if you compare this, this looks a lot better, but that's because again, this is very angular. I'm just going one direction. If I were to do, let's say something more complex, let's just say, you know, here's the terminator again, and we're gonna go this way. One, okay, let's cross it this way. Two, okay, let's just put a bad direction, and let's go one more here. This direction. So you can see how nice you can get a shade. How much just say it's a football. This is a football shape and here's the Terminator. If I'm going to crosshatch, you might ask, well, how do I start? The wrong way to start in crosshatching, if you need to fill in this space, is to go this way. Because this way, you see how, if I do this way, it just kind of breaks it up. So think of it as like any kind of shape. Let's say you want to do you want to shape this kind of thing right. If you want to crosshatch it what you don't want to do is you don't want to go this way right because it's longer. If I go this way I'm going to come here and then this becomes really long and then we'll come here and now what right. You see this right here? I have two two broken up areas so that means I'm going to have to come in here and then come back here like this. This is a lot harder to control Okay, so there's a lot of hand control and this is a total mess so in order to do this kind of shading, you know again Some of my other videos I talk about how you can practice line control is basically, you know doing this kind of shape and then just cross-hatch all the way through and The key is to be able to stop Right on the edge, right? And that's that's where you call hand control now if you're doing this, I'm just gonna shade this area real quick. So this area needs to be darker right here. So obviously I'm not gonna go this way, right? Because again, I'm gonna hit the same problem, the structure a little bit longer. So I'm gonna go this way. I'm gonna go this way like that. So let's say I need to make a once you have the base in there. And now I'm doing a lot lighter. My hands a little bit lighter. Okay, let's say this is darker here. I'll put it down and I lose the sensitivity and when I hit it down, I might hit it too dark and it hit it too light. But if I keep the tip on the paper, I can feel it a lot better and I can control it a lot better. So it's really just kind of like these kind of wiggly shapes and then you just kind of cross those. So other than that, that's pretty much on crosshairs.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back and this is Wei. Thanks for joining me again and for this quick little sketch. Let's just draw this a high-heeled shoes All right, so let's draw this and see how it goes so I have my image on my phone. So I'm just gonna just draw one of them Nice little sketch for the mornings. I'm just gonna 6B again. This would be a little more fun shading. See this actually comes out quite a bit right here on the back. And the heel, that's about. Just checking the angle. So like from the bottom here, I'm checking where that heel goes to. And yeah, probably somewhere around here. Okay, and this part is dark here and this is a little bit reflective like so I'm gonna leave that a little bit lighter. See all the way tip, tip here, this is dark. Alright, let me try to put my phone down so It's nice to have a nice finish area here and we can use that as kind of reference as to how dark things can be and stuff. In order to get a little bit darker you see me turning a little bit more realistic. It's not completely dark. Line here, side here is dark. Side here is dark. Okay, so some highlight here. So this is kind of important. I think people separate that. So I'm just gonna draw a little line there, make sure I don't go over. And then I see the highlights right here nice variation. The 2B is good too, but it just doesn't have that darkness to it. And you end up shading a lot. This is a little bit easier. You can see the strokes a little bit better with the 6B. You just kind of punch it. Let's see. This part should be a little bit lighter. Let's be darker all the way around the edge Because the lights right here So this is kind of like almost like a ball. So this part on very little bit darker. Yeah, let's push it a little bit more see this let's go in and yeah let's just say this it's complicated it's just like I'm in here I'm just like wrinkles here are the creases. This is dark, fades in, here's the toe. So the toe right here is light. Trying to get real images, you know Or muscular ones something, you know where you can see all those little I guess You know real body parts or real muscular structures and not all brushed out like even for this one this image, right? But if you look at reference, that's how it looks like. Let's make this a little bit darker here.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and thanks for joining me here once again. Now for this exercise, I'm going to be shading a water drop on surface and it's a really good exercise for me to show you how you can shade realistically. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let's draw this little water drop on the surface. So I'm just going to sketch in the shape. You got a little highlight there. And I know it's a little bit different from the reference, but it's okay. So we want to draw in this because this is where the reflection is course now that now it's dark, right? I'm just kind of showing it to you So you go light enough, you know, you just you can shade it really subtle and You will need a lot of'm actually doing this kind of wiggly shape and that's how I'm shading it. So it's kind of like and if you do enough of it It will you know even the cell file you see how it all right, of course this one's a little bit messy, but if you know if you do it a little this edge up a little bit, you see how I'm doing these wiggly shapes like this? Real software. Now I can also smudge it, but I might do that later on. But let's just focus on this cast drop because it is actually really good for you to be able to do. Okay, so I'm going to correct the shape a little bit darker, right? So I am going to switch to a 2H. So you have a B and then you have the HB and then you have the 1H and this is a 2H. So it's a lot harder. So if you look at the blind quality spacey, you know, like little cylinder shapes and shading. And you can see how that slowly builds it up, right? Not too quickly. Because you really need to hit all the surface of the paper or the tooth. So if you do a really harsh line, really hard pencil at a 2H, you're gonna lose the surface, right? The texture, you're actually gonna rub it off and it's gonna be super smooth then. And then at that point it gets a little bit harder to actually draw on the surface because it's, you know, the tooth of the paper is gone so it's not gonna hold on to demonstration. All right, so this is dark, dark, dark goes keeps going up. Dark, this is still dark. Now eventually I'm gonna go a little bit darker. I'm gonna park bring in the 2B this up. I think I made this edge. This edge a little bit too hard. So I'm just going to soften it up around. Okay. This top it's coming along let's push it a little bit more before I bring in the 2B pencil so again this is more of the shading and I'm going to highlight much into it. It's actually gone smooth So I gotta be be a bit a little bit careful with that Okay, so it's actually getting there Let me see this part right here. It's bugging me for what a reason a little bit too hard I'm gonna soften it up Let's move it out a little bit more interesting. A little bit more contrast, hopefully it'll pop it out a little bit more. Okay, so that kind of gives that a little bit. Trying to really pop this edge out. Yeah, it feels a lot better, right? See, like, by making this dark, now it's like the wholeB. Let's do the shadows a little bit higher. A little bit deeper. So at this point of the drawing, I'm not as light out with the pencil because I really have to push is wrong or a little bit too light or too dark and how it compares to everything else. It's the same thing as when you squint your eyes. Having a camera there actually helps too so you can see the image, full image, much smaller.\", 'Art'], [\" Here everyone is away and welcome back. Now for this video we're gonna do a really useful exercise and which is to draw a skull and Reason why it's good is because there's a lot of interesting shapes going on here lots of complex forms So it's a really good drawing and shading exercise. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way Alright, so let's start this skull and the first thing you want to do with something like this is Kind of blocking the overall shape and I can can compare where things are. So let's say this is one eye socket, then we can move on to the other eye socket like this. And then keep in mind of the slant. There is obviously, this thing is symmetrical. So there's going to be an overall perspective or slant to this. So going back up here, because I need to get some measurements down here. So we go, let's see, from the corner of the back of the teeth right here, you go straight up, it kind of hits the eye a little bit. So it's gonna be right around there. And then you have the other cheek that way you can. This thing goes up here. There's a lot of little things going on here so let's skip that and move on here see the back of the head comes up and then this thing is gonna go up and I'm gonna go back to see that while this is round, it's gonna keep reminding you that it's round and you'll be able to shade a little bit better. And that's especially true for life drawing. It's a lot of contouring work. So okay, let's see, we have this thing kind of roug show you the more important aspect which is you know shading it and how to make this look like a Give it give it the three-dimensional form. That's the fun part It's like trying teeth is not exactly fun All right, let's see at this point. Okay, I'm refined shading now. So we know this edge is darker, so I'm going to go in and put in a little bit more shading. And you can see that I'm doing crosshatching. I'm not going this way again because I've already done this already. And if I keep doing it, you might end up rubbing the paper too much. But by So I want to show you how far you can take it just by using this B. Okay, so now here is the nose area and again in here is pretty much darker right because it's indented. So I'm gonna shade this area, just give it one quick now, because I can darken it with the 2B or even the 4B. But with this B, you can get some really nice soft shading with this. Here is a little dot here, dot, and then right here is slightly darker, because it actually very important. You see how I'm doing these lines? I'm not necessarily just going, oh, I'm seeing this and then this, that, right? I'm not doing that. I'm actually going like this and then like this and then like this. And you can see there's a big difference in the line quality, right? This is nice and soft and if it looks kind of funny in a photo, even though you know it's real, we don't have to draw like that. Because if you do, actually it might not look good on your giant because I just rotate my arm. I want to make sure I don't get in front of the camera. Let's go down a little bit more. The teeth right dark so I'm just gonna hit it harder and again if I want a harder line I'm turning my pencil so I get that nice the short strokes really helps because again, you don't want a flat line like that. It's just shade it slowly and carefully. It's really be observant to what you're seeing. Because if you end up doing a line, you're gonna lose the bulge and that's when the shapes don't come through. And you're gonna wonder why, you know, it's looking kind of hard to see on camera sometimes. Another reason I like to sketch with darker pencils on camera. So you can see this whole top area where I pay a little bit more attention. You can start feeling the structure, the little bumps and stuff. And now I can make it a little bit darker and then do it again maybe like a smaller scale. All right, so that gives you a nice, you know curvature of this rounding back and that's exactly what is happening. Obviously with the stringium. Let's go, okay. So at this gonna rub it in here and why I'm doing this because it's kind of like that on the reference but also I'm trying to enhance this this white area right here so it might actually make this a little bit darker like this and that will by making the surrounding area darker see how this thing is coming up. And then here, slightly darker. So now this piece is coming alive is starting to, the edges of the two foot paper is starting to round out, starting to smooth out. So you have to be careful because too much shading is eventually just gonna die out. You're gonna be so flat that you won't be able I'm actually shaded. You might not see it now because it's still, you know, things are just, there's nothing on the paper to compare to. But once you start laying in some shade, you will see those. I guarantee you that. You're gonna see all this little stuff. Like right here, I'm looking inside the eye now. There's all these little things going on here. So, and I am using a 2B now, so it's a little bit darker, the reference at this point, you can squint your eyes a little bit so you can see the overall shading of this eye socket. If you squint your eyes at it, what do you see? Well, you can't see a couple of dots here and there, whatever. So these little cracks, let's say the cracks, you can just kind of go in. Again, try not to do a continuous line, just kind of a little bit w me so never got into that All right, I'm not going to around above modern art, but All right, see here Darker here and I'm seeing these little those little shadow shapes subtle shapes and There's a lot of little markings here so I can gonna make this darker. That way this edge, little thing can area darker. Now these edges in here need to be darker.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone welcome back and good to have you guys back once again and for this video I'm just kind of like loosely drawn in These a couple of pairs and now just talk about the different ways of shading and different ways of drawing It's kind of fun and kind of loosens you up a little bit You know just so that you can get into the mode of sketching a little bit more alright, so Let's just try to sketch don't have to be all that accurate but overall you do want to get the proportions a little correct right so that we can I'm just gonna hit that a little bit darker. There's where it touches the, I guess, table. And this part should be a little bit darker, because it's underneath. And then here, the edge, rounding off, so you can just I can outline that. So let's just give this one shade. Because I kind of want to shade it a couple of different ways or maybe even a few different ways. Okay, so here, this part right here, behind it starts. I'm just gonna push right into it and then you can add in some variations, you know, it's making a little bit darker in certain areas. Again, it's organic so think of it that way. So this red right here should be a little bit darker so the ground, really hit that because right there it's pretty dark as it's touching. And then of course some shadow. Thatened up and try to draw in the important things, the bigger features. And I always like it, the look of and lighting. Now if I really wanted to and I can go in and clean it up a little bit and you try to be a little bit more professional in my shading if go over a lot. It's just like, I wish I can do it better. So like here, they can do this. This can be darker. Dark here. A little bit darker on the bottom. Highlight's right here. Yeah, I don't know if this is turning out well little bit. Dark green side. Let's. So instead of doing things like this and then this to get it dark, immediately just go in and get it correct. That's what I'm trying to do. Darker and a little bit lumpy. This bar is, I hope I can minimize the amount of strokes, but I couldn't because I just couldn't get the shake correct and I just have to go in and just kind of experiment and just have fun, you know? You feel like doing something in a certain way, just try it out. Where do I work? It doesn't really matter. Because if nothing else, you learn a lot about hand control.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back to the other way and thanks for joining me again. I know it's been a while and hopefully I still kind of remember how to sketch because you know sometimes you do kind of lose a little bit of the the repetitiveness and you can lose some of the touch so hopefully it hasn't been that long that you know I can actually I can actually make a decent drawing from this so I'm gonna be I'm gonna be drawing this character from Squid Games and I'm just's a model, so I guess that's why you look good as a model with larger lips. Okay, it's definitely very unique. Okay, so let's see. You hope you guys can see that. I'm sketching really light right here. So I'm just gonna come up here on her I am using a 6B here. I just got out of top of the eyes. It's very sharp right here. It kind. And even for the eye right here, there's usually a little bit of a castor and a shadow from the eyelids. Okay, I spin a while, sketching and I can definitely feel it here. Feeling very stiff right here, okay? All right, so a little bit more shading up here. How the eyeball kind of goes around. So this part right here is dark. And then here's the nostril. And I don't know if you guys can hear the airplane outside. A lot of little noises. Okay, so for the nostril a little bit more lightness to it. So for a little right here, so upper lip it's gonna be slightly darker so I'm just gonna give. Some cheeks coming down. Hair, hair's gonna be right here. And we can add in some of the color, just to anchor things down. Should be out here, okay, placement's a little bit off. Okay, so now let's come back in and give it another pass. So that was kind of like the first pass and now let's add in some more shading. Okay, so the eye in here, corner, darker. So now, right here, it's darker. So I'm just gonna come in here. Okay, so that'll be the same thing here. Okay, so here's the chin, here's the highlight of the chin. So now I'm gonna shade the bottom right here. This part, so the darker is on the chin on the bottom. And then it's gonna kind of smooth out see, let's give this one shade. And let's see, okay. It's getting there. I mean, it the face here needs some work. So I'm just going to add in some hair lines. So again, I'm just going to keep this angular. And I So let's continue on with the hair. Let me see. I'm, it's okay. That wasn't too important. All right. Hair, let's just keep going. Here's darker, so I'm just gonna give it one shade and then I can define it better kind of ignored everything else. Okay, so yeah, the top, okay, I'm not gonna go too far on this, because it is kind of a lot of this kind of shading. All right, the reference is running out anyway. So I might darken it later. But let me fill in, try to give a little bit darker. So now I'm seeing a little bit more. It's like, you know, whenever you start shading, then you start seeing more and more little subtle things. And that's just how it is. Unless I was like a real pro and stuff, then, you know, I can recognize that. And I think you've seen a lot of people being able to sketch like that. And it's pretty amazing, right, when you can just kind of draw these little circle shapes that works pretty well too. So you want to make it a little bit harder where you just kind of push in a little bit. Or just turn the pencil a little bit and just kind of hit that a little bit harder and that's how you get all of judge those things. So if you know this is gonna be slightly darker, then just make it darker than this and it will kind of help to build out the form. So this part right here is pretty eyes. But right now at this point, it's just a lot of little finessing. Dark right here. All right, so how does that look? I don't think that looks like her. Does it look like her? Yeah, kind. Yeah, the features are a little bit off. I mean, I think this eyes way high and needs to be moved in.\", 'Art'], [\" Here everyone is away and welcome back. Let's draw a couple of spoons and I know it might sound really simple but it's actually very important because I'm going to be talking about the basics of drawing and how you can draw these kind of spoons with different properties. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright so let's draw this metal spoon and because of the metal texture, you know the texture you see in there is actually reflecting the environment so just kind of keep that in mind. So the best thing to do this kind of stuff is very simple curves are still very complex and let's see, alright so let's... so here it is the rough shape and you know if you're doing this and it doesn't turn out to be exactly this kind of shape you know to your reference it's okay because you know as long as you can do... as long as you can shade it's just really, you're basically going from almost pitch black into almost white. So we can actually go in. So here's some midtones right here and this is dark. And it might not look like see, I'm gonna do the rim here, the edge. So the edge right here is dark. So I'm turning my pencil once in a while so I can get like a sharper edge, right? Because when you start shading, you'll notice that, you know, the tip starts to get a little bit fl So just keep that in mind. Some angles will be a little bit more uncomfortable. And you can always turn the paper if you want, but I'm not going to turn it around just so that, just kind of push it in. Don't baby it too much, just kind of go in and like right here is really dark, just go in and just kind of push it a little bit, I'll just change to the paper. You know that way it won't get too dark. But let me just work with the four since, you know, it's if you don't have different gradation of the grades of the pencil, you know, this way you can, it's all doable, you know, don my pencil here because this is a really sharp edge. Let's bring it all a little bit more. And I know I probably need some white right here. Looks like I covered it a little bit more shape right? Like it doesn't feel without real to you. So you gotta be a little bit careful. Just kind of just look at it, you know, careful observation. Like even like right here. Same makes your main frame. All right. All right. So right here is dark. And right here, it's a little bit lighter. But it also comes's a little bit darker but also because the shadow down here is a little bit lighter so this part looks a little bit darker. So just by contrast you know because I have a dark shadow here that's why this part is white. I have a very light shadow here that's why this feels dark. So it's little things like that you know just trying to keep in mind you know drawing is porcelain, so it's a little bit lighter in terms of reflectiveness, so it doesn't reflect the surface of the environment as much. So things because a lot of it is So I'm gonna cross hatch. Going this way. And I'm always switched pencils This is a 2B's this because it's softer but it's okay. Again, as long as we control the, how hard you push into it, it's fine. Alright, so let's make it a little bit darker now. Just gonna hit this a little bit harder. Again's have my 4B here. I think it should be a little bit of shading because again, this is kind of like a warped shape. It's like a cylinder. So it's stretching the environment. That's why you see these long shadows, because it's reflecting the environment. It's kind of stretching it. It's kind of reflective surfaces. But it's not as hard as the metal one because\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's do some tree drawings and I'm gonna show you some quick and easy ways so you can draw any kind of tree even without reference. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let's draw some trees and it's actually really simple. The main thing is to remember is that you know you don't want to do a lot of details. Alright, so let me just start off with a tree trunk. Just kind of show you how simple you can show something like this and I'm not gonna, some texturing going on so you can just kind of wiggle in different directions so you can get some nice texturing and let's just say right here maybe even some of the grooves going on in there and if you keep tree because I'm just going to draw some limbs right here. Let's just say there's a big... Let's make it chopped off. Let's just say... So here's the bottom. It's going to be a little bit darker. And again, I'm shading a little bit. Just adding a little bit more interest to it. Let's just here this way. So I know this is a lot of part, this is gonna be light and then in here it's gonna be darker, right? So you can actually draw, let's just say, so to make the leaves come up white, what you need to do is to shade in areas that are dark and automatically, like if I? So by making this dark here, now it feels like, you know, this, this definitely light coming from this side. So that's how, you know, drawing these leaves work. It's just. Okay, so let's just say I don't know another branch here. Maybe a little bit more foliage here. Okay, a small tree I guess, right? Maybe like a softer shape kind of foliage. So the bottom is darker here. And then you have the bright area on the top. Yeah. Yeah, this one doesn't come out as good. Well, let's see if keep it consistent to what I've drawn and see. Anything good comes out of it. Okay, so this goes up and let's just say, I don't know, with some more little leaves. Yeah, let's do something like that. There's some more branches coming up. And then let's just see, for more interest, let's just say, you know, there's some branches here on the back. We can actually do some more and just kind of make it dark. Just kind of wiggle like this. Dark, dark. So we can keep these in the background. We can either make it dark or light.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and thanks for joining me here once again. So for this video I'm gonna be wrapping up the series on drawing and shading simple geometric shapes and this one is gonna be on the sphere. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let, now to figure out where the shadow will end, where the terminator is, where the light will not be hitting the surface of this sphere. Just calculate this distance right be like Let me switch to a 4B I was using a 2B pencil. So this would actually be like the moon, right? So if you were to draw the moon and trying to figure out You know how to shade it you figure out what the light source is what a Sun is and then you can you can middle. Now take this distance right here, push it over here. This distance, push it from the center here. So roughly you probably will have your right around there. So now you have the center and this is where the light's going to end. So we're going to draw an ellipse right here, inside. All the way through. Now the reason I'm drawing all the way through know you you might do something like this And then you realize this is probably a little bit too sharp. That's really do to the back This right here is a little bit too sharp. It actually needs to round off more so if so if you draw the back more That way you can see the lips is it's nicely round. It's circle. We're going to find the center. Let's do the light. Let's just say somewhere right here. Here's the center. There's the light source hot spot right there. Draw a line and from dark to light. So I'm just gonna start off dark here. Again I'm using 4B. I'm not going to go into detail for too much detail into this. The light directions here, so we can go right there. So shadows can end right around here, right? That's the top and the bottom is going to be right around here, right? So usually with... And I'll go into a little more detail now, how to make this thing a little bit more realistic because, you know, if we play with the shading a little bit, we can get them. Much better form. Alright, so now we have this, which is pretty good. But with circles, again, there's... The environment is always, you know, hitting the edges from the environment. So that's when when you see realistic shading of a sphere, you have this kind of shape like that. With an edge, all around the edge is a little bit more. Make this really dark. Just kind of pushing with the pencil real far. Okay, so it's... I mean the whole process is pretty easy. It's just, you know, get used to Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker Darker\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's draw a chrome ball and also talk about how you can draw and shape any kind of shiny surfaces. So let's get started and talk about the process along the way. Right, let's draw a chrome ball and this is kind of yeah this beepy a little bit kind of fun with exercise. So I'm gonna draw see make sure I'm able to get in frame. Okay well this is actually a you know, it's actually the environment and it gets warped because of the curved surface. So, just kind of remember that, you know, whenever you're doing anything kind of shiny, it's just what you're really drawing inside here is the environment, but in a very warped state. And, you know,'s kind of it's usually you know reflecting all the light areas right around the edge so there's always a little bit of border I guess you can call it right so I'm gonna start shading this dark and I'm using a 2B a little bit right. It just, you feel like it's coming alive. And I know this part right here down here is darker. Let's see, I'm gonna, I mean It's darker and the edge right here And again, this is a 2b so I don't want to push too hard if I want a want. I think as long as you get the gradations, it'll look like chrome. So this whole edge right here looks like it's dark. So it could be, you know, reflecting the environment right here, right? Because it's kind of warping the environment. It's condensing the environment. It tends to have very sharp edges. Because you're kind of... So you're taking the edge of the table and squeezing it into a very sharp. The edge of put my head right over this thing. You can tuck your shoulder in see it, but yeah, it's a lot of little shading so it's just kind of repetitive But basically that's what it is, you know If I stop talking I'll loosen up a little bit and I'll be able to sketch a little bit better Okay So Alright, I'm back and here's my final drawing for this chrome ball. I don't know if I'm successful or not. I just kind of add it in just a little bit of reflection and shine to it. Hopefully I can give this chrome a little bit more bling. But overall, yeah, I think it's okay. I think the reference I'm drawing from, it's not hyper realistic, so I'm kind of missing some of the elements. But overall, you know, that's kind of, if you want to make anything chrome, just remember you are reflecting\", 'Art'], [' I used to know the world, the seas of rise where I gave the world down in the morning asleep alone Sweet the streets I used to know Oh Never a honest word But that was when I wrote the word', 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back. This is Wei and let's draw another pretty face. I haven't done this for a while and I'm gonna be using a 10v just like what I did last time. Of course, this one is gonna be what last one is a mask. So this one is a real portrait. So hopefully I can, you know, capture the features on this and actually make it look pretty. Alright, so I'm gonna start with the eye first. This is gonna be a slant. Let's see. My pencil is really sharp. Maybe it's a little bit too sharp. Alright, so the way down here. So it's gonna be right around here. So that's gonna be the wings of the nose. And then from there, I can just kind of rough in the other shapes. So here's the nostrils. Up. It's a shadow. Okay, let's keep going here. See, here's the center line right here, right? So, so that we can get the correct slant on the face. Chin goes up, jawline, your eye, eye ball right around here. We can always make the eyes a little too high. All right, how's that? Okay, see the forehead? We can skip that for now. Here's the side, here's the highlight Here's the pupil shade and the eyes usually dark on the top here at the eyeball Light on the. Middle dark and this, actually this top part, let's just go with that. Alright, so let's come back to the nose. Okay, so the highlights right here, there's gonna be another highlight right here. We can identify that. And then this bottom part, we just give it one shape first because this is, you can just kind of imagine like the nose or this part's gonna be darker. Maybe a little too darker. I'll make, it looks a little bit off. there and then we can add in. Okay, let's add this part is weird. And this is way too long. This bothering me, it looks like it faces stretching out and being warped up. Okay, so here, now we can draw in, let's give a little bit of shading here. Again, this thing is look weird. All right, let's just keep going. Okay, so now that is a little more blunt, I come in here and adding a shade. So here's the earring, okay, whatever, we can skip that. And then if you wanna add in this part dark and now just bring out the ear, then here's the hair. And there's not much detail there, so it's kinda hard for me to see, I think this is mostly all dark. So let's just forget about that. Let's come back up here. Right now that I too blue at all mode. So maybe that's what makes you feel better sometimes. It's just like when your pencil is too sharp, you just feel like you can nit-picking too much, right? You just wanna draw. I'm gonna keep things lively, I'm down here. I'll just try to lip the tricky. And then right here, a little bit darker. down see I'm underneath the eye so this part Eyebrow this part's darker right here. There is variation on the eyebrow. Like this part on the tip right here, you see usually a little bit softer. And then it gets a little if I were to keep going, it would be more of the same. Let's go ahead and just try smudging it a little bit and see how it goes. I'm just gonna use my finger to soften things up a little bit. Usually you don't do this,. Come back in. There's really cool highlights here that you really need. I don't have my electric racer with me right now is more difficult when I can't put my head over the drawing. I'm trying to talk. Okay, that's better. See, once I make this darker, the whole face just comes out. You're like, I knew something was bad. Let's make this even darker. So it's kind of nice. Now that I've smoot, it's a little bit nearly gritty stuff. Okay, so, yeah, hope you guys enjoyed this little video. It's been a while, I haven't drawn it, okay. Portrait for so long. I feel't have to move your head as much. That's normally when I'm sketching from here, I actually have it in front of me. So, end up moving your head a lot and it makes it a little bit harder. So, you can just get your head right over it. That way you can just put it side to side and you end up seeing a lot more little and little things that you would give your reference a further away.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back and this morning. Let's draw something different and I know I've been drawing a lot of portraits and other stuff. Let's try some flowers. I got some images of these flowers. Maybe I'll just do some quick sketches with the with these flowers with number two pencil and Just kind of go over it. Maybe kind of be a little bit more loose a little bit more sketchy So let's see where that goes. All right, so I generally don't draw this kind of stuff, but I mean, you then the outside just around. Then let's see out here. Here, bump here. Petal. Petal. And see this big one over here? Now I can divide it up. Now that I have more of a major shape, now I'll draw in the little too many major lines other than this right here. On the petals it's actually very wavy. And the shading part of this of any kind of curvature. If you just keep repeating it, you'll notice that you can actually keep running. It's kind of strange, just like a motor. And that's why when you're sketching, you just kind of want to keep everything moving. And when it is the correct line, what happens when you're doing this, your hand will automatically just kind of push in more, so the direction of the strokes, I always like to go like if it's vertical like this, I mean go in this direction. I always like to go this way, it's supposed to go in that way because this way is a lot harder, it's kinda cool. So this edge is important because when I make this door, this thing's gonna pop right out. So there's some variations right here. It's a little bit of curve right there. A little bit of crease. Okay, so let's concentrate in here. So right here, just a little bit is slightly darker here. And then the bottom right here is dark. Let's come to this one. If you look at this smaller petal here, it's slightly darker than this. So I'm just gonna make this a little bit darker. And then will help to pop this edge out. So that's really how it rose, is because it's folding on top of each other. You're gonna get a lot of this illusion right here. And if we exaggerate them, it will help make the flower a little bit more threeate it. This edge here, I'm just gonna simplify this because it's smaller detail. I don't want to draw too much of this because everything else is kind of rough. Just gonna come around, see it here. Yeah, this, oh, it doesn't have a lot of life. Mainly because if you look at this kind straight Just looks they are very robotic Just kind of come in here and just kind of mess things up a little bit more Okay, I want to add more of this This is okay I'm just gonna just catch it like this. It doesn't necessarily have to be exactly the same obviously Okay, so one two three and Then in between there's one more so don't know if that's just the lighting or the flowers itself. It looks like it's wider on the inside here. So right here, this is the highlight. And then when it turns in, this is is darker. Starker's right here, this actually curves in, so this is a little bit of shading. Let's start right here. Okay, I know that's scanning course. I'm just squinting my pencil was dull but also was a little bit looser and you can kind of see the difference right? this is a lot more softer and this is a little just looks a little dead so let me know if you guys any other subject that you want me to draw or even if it's a certain type of flowers, just let me know in the comments. And if something cool, I could definitely draw it. I mean, even if it's not cool, I still draw it. It's nice to draw different things.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back and let's do another Taylor Swift drawing and Hopefully it looks like her if not, hopefully it would just be a pretty face. So let's get started and talk about the process along the way All right, so to draw this face I'm gonna do like a little slant right here just to show me the overall slant or her face kind of goes up a little bit so I'm kind of rusty right now. I haven't been enjoying this for The sketch for I do like a vertical line from my eye it's gonna hit the side of her nose right here so it's gonna be somewhere right here I'm gonna check the angle so you go from let's say the corner of the eye just kind of it's kind of envisioned out on your reference it's kind of like this and if I come straight down it's almost like right around here. So we'll do that. We're the cleary right around our eye. Come straight down. That's our other corner of the lip. And we can actually measure like angles like here and here just to give ourselves a little bit more reference point. Yeah, you know on her eye. So you're not going to erase it back out. Okay, right here. When you draw on the lid, don't hit it too hard. Just kind of do a little bit and try to do the your... It kind of relaxes you a little bit, you know, because if you start out too light and you know, it's just gonna take you a long time. Again, trying to save for the highlights. Lid. This is dark here. Be careful this line right here. then all the sudden it turns into an illustration Okay, so nostrils and here you can hit a little bit harder, right? right here is dark. Dark, dark right here. is dark everything's under in the shade so just do enough So it's gonna be lighter. So I'm just trying to read, you know, some of the hair is doing. Okay. So that, let's see, here's a little bit messy. This part, it's a little bit messy, so I'm just gonna give it some strokes here, here. Okay,'m kind of rushing through it. You know, here are They look very nice when it's fully rendered, but I just don't have the patient for it right now. I wanna finish this drawing to too much detail. So I got a warm up sketch for me since dark underneath here is dark. Dark. Here. Yeah, the eyes looking a little bit better. Okay, right here is darker. So I'm seeing like Bugs Bunny This is like one of those things right? It's like how did I correct that? a little bit harder. See what works, you know? See, sometimes you can't see all your mistakes and you're like trying to find out, jeez, what is it that's messing you're trying up? Here. Yeah, I'm just gonna simplify it's just too simplified. This is dark here. Dark here. And now we can put in a little bit of detail on the strand. This is coming exercise. All right so yeah you know I might finish up more later but you know when I walk away I'll come back and look at it maybe I'll see something that's obviously a mistake or it's improvement but overall I think that's it. Yeah that's it so I'm gonna\", 'Art'], [\" Welcome back and this is Wei and let's just draw this. I haven't drawn some anatomy for a while. So let's just draw this little bicep area, chest area just to work out some of the shadows and how we can shade muscle overall. So it's actually kind of fun. I haven't done this for a while. So I'm just kind of draw in... You see, so this will be, this is going to be the chest, the pecs muscle I thinkp. I'm just gonna join some lines real quick. So you can see what I'm drawing. So here's the chest. This thing goes up. See, this. Here's the middle. There's a shadow coming down here. And the light's coming from the top. So here's the highlight for this. And it's kind of fade around here. And here's the terminator right here. So this is like a little ball right here. Literally, it's like a little ball. Okay. So this part right here is going to come down here. Little bump here. And then for the chest right here, here's this other circle. It's a little bit flatter, but here's the terminator. So right around here. So I'm just heading to keep this one shade. Now there's a lot of reflective lighting here. So by shading this it will give me a good sense of the form here. So this of got rid of some of the lines right here. So here's the Terminator. This part's really dark. Okay, so right here's a little bit interesting here. So this part right here is the reflective light and this right here is actually the shadow from up top and the shadow tends to be So that's kinda the idea. All right, let's keep going here. All right, I'm getting a little sidetracked. Okay, so here's the Terminator. Let's hit that hard again. So this part is really dark right here. So I'm just gonna hit that. So here's the Terminator right here. This part's a little bit darker and then this part's darker as well. So now I'm just seeing little patches. Okay so get, let's come back to here because this part's interesting because this right here in here is really dark. So that's gonna help, help, um, bulge this muscle out I guess. You know, a little bit contrast here. When you catch the, when you're shading the bounce lights, it really helps. So just a matter of observation. Okay, so really hot highlight right here. Okay, so here's the nipple, of want to work around. Okay, so right here is going to be in the shade right here. So we can kind of ignore that. There's not much going on anyways. But let's make this part a little bit darker right here because it's going to help pop out the actually really cool. Okay, so again, here's the shadow. This is shadow from this and this is in the shade. So the shade is lighter. Let's I'm gonna hit this. So this is dark. Comes down. So let's draw in, let's determine it here for this. Terminate is right around here. It comes across and the terminator here. You know you would have this or let's say it was a really flat ball. If the ball is really flat like this then this would be a little bit tighter right because it's sharper edge. So that's how you would see the difference in the shading. So you go this one's a little bit more spread out I don't want to go too dark. I'm just using a four B right here. I guess I can push in some of the part. All right, so let's come back up here. Let's add in some details. Okay, now I'm just going to see that. So if I want to hit it harder, I really have to turn to the edge. Get a nice sharp edge right here. This part is a most interesting part I think. A little shadow right here. And if I really wanted to, with little veins and stuff, you know, good way of shading is just like that, that, that, you know, turn the direction, whatever. Just, if I see this darker here or this, or this is lighter, you know, just try to see in little, little groups. It's a little bit easier sometimes. dark. Slightly lighter. Here's the chest in the middle. A little bit wiggly lines. Come in here again, back here. Okay. So sometimes you kind of have to go spread out a little bit, right's the Terminator, let's make that a little bit darker. But overall, I think that's about it. I guess I can always add in more veins because there's so many of them. Okay. Okay, right here's a little strange. All right, so you know, when you're sketching this, just try to visualize the big forms first.\", 'Art'], [\" All right, welcome back to the other way and yeah, I actually have a little bit more time now now that the kids are back in school So let's draw something kind of basic and simple, but we're gonna put them all together Just I think this little ropa taki is actually a very good way of to illustrate you know and how we can shade and draw basic shapes and how everything can come together So that we can create a little bit more the body is kind of like, it's almost like an egg shape. I mean, it's not symmetrical. So, but the bottom is flat right here. So we can draw this. And then here's the back. So I guess that we have the all these basic shapes, let's just go ahead and blend everything in and we'll create shapes. Okay so here's the necklace around that out a little bit more. And then the eyes, these are just stickers. Then we this part a little bit darker. Actually join the eyes first. A little bit stiff right now, having it drawn for I guess. Yeah, much better. Yeah, two sharper pencils is I hate drawing with that. It turns into a very clean illustration and it's harder to shade. So you can see how much softer this is compared to this part be a little bit easier to illustrate that way. Okay, so now that we've got the highlight here, it's getting darker here and here's some neck. So this part here, this is where they kind of knocked it out. Okay, so the sparse dark here. And then so it's this part here as it rose away. Okay, so now we have to shade in the wing as I can now shade in this part. Okay. Okay. Okay, that was my little alarm going off. I don't know if you guys heard it. Gonna have to stop a This dark dark. Okay, let's come back up here. Let's make this a little bit darker, make it a little bit more correct. So right here there's a highlight here. I got to watch out. Let's show a line right there. That's going to be my highlight. Here's the edge. So this part is the darkest. Bottom, darker. And then we have bounce layer but that's okay. Now that I've shaded in, I can see the shapes and it's not correct or the proportions a little bit off, but that's okay. Okay, so I think that is pretty much it for the shading part. I mean, I can come in here, let's try to accentuate some area just to make it pop a little bit more. Especially once you have this part in, everything else kind of looks very bland, right eraser get rid of some of that this part right here is a little bit darker okay so I'm just there, you know, if you can't, if your shading becomes like this or things are off, it's just because you don't have enough hand control. And you'll get, it seems simple at the beginning, but once you start shading the basic shapes and you see the bounce lights and everything, it's actually quite complicated, right? So that's why these little basic shapes are really\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back to the other way and for this video it's gonna be a, I guess a pretty simple tutorial on how you can draw a pyramid. Alright, since I have drawn the other shapes, let's go ahead and maybe wrap it up by drawing a simple pyramid. So for the pyramid, the most important thing is to draw the base first. So let's just draw a little square in perspective. So I'm just gonna draw a simple one like this. Okay So that's the pyramid. And this one right here, this is going to be the back, right? So we won't see that. Actually, this was going to be the back, too. So this should be a dotted line. So that's pretty much it for this. Any kind of pyramid you want to draw, just draw on the base, find the center, and then just go straight up and then way to the floor. So we have one line, here's the floor, and then from the light source, we're just going to hit this corner and we're going to keep extending it until we intersect with this line here on the floor. So I'm just free-handing everything here. Let's make this tip nice and sharp. Okay, so that's the shadow. And then this one actually, you know, because we're not facing the the light source directly. So this should be it, let's put it here. Let's see which way. All right, let's put it out here. Here's the floor. Here's the lamp. We'll go up here. Okay, so extend this line on the floor, wherever it is, and then we just connect this. Okay, so this is gonna be a tip.\", 'Art'], [\" Alright, welcome back and this morning I was kind of in the mood to draw some, maybe just do some quick sketches of figure drawing and so I was looking online and I saw this image which is kind of cool. He's very lean, he's got some nice tones. It's not ballgame muscles or anything but I think there's enough where we can have some fun sketching this. Alright, so for figure drawing I mean there's so many different ways of drawing things. I think if I remember like you know here's a rib cage and they actually draw and all those other anatomy which is kind nuts but you know that's the correct way of doing a life drawing I guess to really learn the human body and it's very complex it this one, so here's the chest and then here's the arm and yeah, there's a lot of, I'm just going right over these lines and then so what life drawing is just kind of want to draw like some figures without going through all that. And what I would probably do might not be as successful though. It's actually just draw what I see. So here's the chest. He's bending in. Okay, so here's the pelvis. We do need that. His legs coming out. Here's the knee and then this other leg. There's the little angle here. We can exaggerate that. Here is the knee. We can make it a little bit harder. It comes out. Let's come back up here. This is how I would draw it. Just to have a little more flexibility. I don start with the head and you end up drawing the body you might realize that the balance is off But if you draw the you know most of the body first and then you can kind of draw the head you can part's dark. There's a little bit of shape here. This part's dark, the bicep. And then underneath here, again, this one's dark and then here's the hand. I can draw the lower part or the bottom part is always a little bit darker. This part's darker and then it's got, oh, we got so I just erased that. So with sketching, yeah, just do it fast, you know, don't worry if things are wrong. We can always fix it like here's the knee. So I'm really adjusting things again. Okay, it goes down a little bit. This part could be a little bit darker. There's a little bounce light here. If I make this darker It's short right here, it's black. So, I mean, there is some here, but not as much because it is black. I'm going to turn my pencil so I get a nice sharp edge, just push that in. And all along the edge on the more life when we're free and not always in shading with one area because it will give the light falls off. So here's some, there's a bulge here in the bottom. There's bulge here. And then the top, we can exaggerate that. Just make it a little bit bigger. It's always good to exaggerate actually when you're drawing if you actually make this a little bit darker you you actually feel more weight to this and you'll help anchor everything so the foots and hands are very important and obviously my proportion is way off right here right this is needs to be longer but okay let's just forget that let's come back here this leg is cool this leg's got a lot of cool stuff going on here Once in a while you have to do some life drawing. You care too much about accuracy it really ruins things Okay, the hand again more complicated This bar stalker some I think the fingers are bent Okay, so I'm just I this, these are like the smaller, I guess not as bulging, and the lighting is a little bit flatter, like the biceps right here. Instead of going this way, I can go this way. And that would really help to give this, you know, just some more, some more form. Dark. The chest right here, we can go this way. All right, now you feel like there's muscle going down that way. Here, let sometimes I can miss the highlight right there. Boging here. So sharper again, I'm to keep turning my pencil. And push down as hard. I this part's darker here. Let's come back here. Let's try to refine this. This knee is really cool. It's I didn't do much off camera. The camera just kind of went off without me knowing. So I just kind of continue shading a little bit more. Not too much. I think you saw everything on camera already. So if you like this and my other art, please do check me out at my Patreon page. Just check out my art.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Now for this exercise, let's just draw something fun which is this shark and this shark has some pretty cool dynamic shapes and textures. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let's draw this shark. So this is nothing too serious,, I guess what you call the snout or is that the tip of the face. Her head, okay, and then go this way. So now I'm just kind of checking the, and then the fin on the top. Let's see let's do this let's draw in see looks like looks like she got a little injury right here but she got bitten or something all right I'm just gonna join this gray patch area's kinda wiggly shapes. It's kinda fun, you know, when you shade like this once in a while, just keep going, you know, wherever you see like a little harder area, you just push down on it a little bit more. So it's very important in the other direction to crosshatch it. So these woodless pencils are I'm seeing more and more details on the various tone on the body. I'm just going to concentrate on this area a little bit. It is kind of let the form develop. I hate this. I'm getting some breakage with these pencils and it's really annoying. It's like you can feel the scraping. It's got little chunks. I don't know why is that. I think it's just the. So let's see if I wanted to let me I'm gonna switch to this It's the AP so it's actually quite a jump. Let me try that. I just want to hit this horror Okay, like a really dark tone on it So it kind of read, you know, you sometimes end up doing a lot of shading. And I know it happens to, you know, a lot of you guys too. So don't worry about, don't worry, because I don't worry too much about that. It's just, it's better, sometimes better to go slow and fun sketching. Yeah, see I'm just gonna do a little bit the water. So by not talking anymore, it really kind of helped me with finishing out this drawing. So here I'm doing the background, which is kind of the tricky part because I want the shark to blend in, to be anchored to the paper and having some kind of shading\", 'Art'], [\" Right welcome back and let's draw this pretty cool looking antique book I know it's not real antique It's just kind of like a reproduction to make it look like it's antique with right so let's begin let's see So you have to start out with the perspective be the box and then we got drawing the lip right now. So we're gonna let's give it, let's make it about this stick. Might be a little be a midpoint here. Okay, so, yeah, if your perspective, I mean, even mind this is a little bit off, is if this is off and then when you find the middle is going to be off, but I guess it's better than eyeballing sometimes. So this will be the middle. So let's just say we get a moving for a little bit. I'm looking at the darkest spot right here. I'm just gonna shade that in real quick. I just want to hit some dark spots and I am using a 10b so it's gonna be nice and soft so that part is probably the darkest right here and I'm gonna Try to save the highlight as well. So I'm just pushing in trying to get the, we don't have to go all crazy and make this all dark. Okay, and then we're all on the edge right here. It's gonna be pretty black, there's a lot of reflective surface. So I know I'm doing in patches, hopefully when'm just gonna try to draw whatever this type C and that's all these little details. And the strokes can be very short, you know, whatever in here. Yeah, it seems kind of fun sometimes. So this texture obviously needs to be darker. I'm also a little sharpen up my pencil and add in the little details here and there. So here's a little rip here which is kinda cool. So for the rip you just have to identify what is, I know that little piece is kinda orange, that's when the top leather is worn darker. Let's try in the Bottom here and then we're drawing the page because the page is kind of interesting The pages are pretty Let's try right now. I think that'll be kind of cool. So let's see We just drawing some lines's a lot more interesting to me. So this part right here is in shadow, so it's really dark. Let's add in some more lines. Here. So really dark, I'm really pushing in. Now that's dark. Okay, so it looks like, well actually it's pretty dark. It's definitely a lip here. You can see this part's a little bit darker. And then the bottom here's a little bit darker. That's a highlight. It gets a little tricky half of it first Now connect the other half so it takes a little bit of a hand control so let's see how well here. See how that looks. Notice yeah, this area really helps right now. It feels like there's just more depth to it. Now you have a wider range. Okay, so I think that really works. Okay, so I think this is pretty much done unless, you know, we can just kind of fun. I haven't done this for a long time. You know, step away and maybe I'll come back. I see something and, you know, maybe I add in a little bit more detail. But overall, I think this is kind of fun. Yeah, really enjoy this. So hopefully this is helpful to you guys and\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone this is Wei and welcome back. Now for this drawing I'm going to be doing a very small portrait of Marilyn Monroe using a 6D pencil. So obviously this is a speed painting, I'm just talking over it. So right off the bat my pencil is relatively dull and this allows me to shave very quickly and especially with a 6D pencil is very soft so you can actually cover a lot of area very quickly. And because I am drawing so small and the head itself on the paper is probably only and It should look like and then you start shading it the same way and then it becomes not very realistic because it's just what's in your head and it's not really what's in the reference. So... Yeah, the eyes are... difficult because I actually had to go in a couple of times to adjust this. But, you know, again, if you're shading, if you join, you know, portraits and stuff, just for fun like this, you know, don't worry about the light. So they just work on other stuff because there's so much\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's try these cups and I'll go over some of the very basic but very important lessons for drawing. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let's draw some cups and I know what you're thinking. You know, you're probably thinking this is too easy for you, but believe me, if you're a beginner artist, this is very, very important because, you know, the cup is kind of like a basic geometry shape and, you know, a lot of more complex things are basically just a bunch of simple geometries put together. So, acute, but there's still, you know, there's still curvature there. So don't ever make it sharp like that because that's gonna be raw. So that's one of the first points about drawing anything like this, like a cup. All right, so let's continue on with this. Just gonna go down. And this is another challenge too, is to make something that is symmetrical. It's actually very difficult. And, you know sketch it in like this you get a much more accurate Curve and This is a very important point is that whenever you can whenever you join something that's three dimensional You know try to sketch in the back too because that will give you a lot of You'll be able to visualize this this whole shape's so many reference lines, even on something as simple as a cup. So we're gonna shade this and now this is round obviously, a cylinder. So this part here is gonna be dark and you can see that on the reference. So this is where it gets a little bit tricky right because the inside here is dark and it's a gradation you know so you have this one edge right here that's dark because light is hitting it's not hitting this part and this is where it's gonna give actually a couple of three-dimensionality to it so this lip right here and the go on to the other area. So right here is a little bit darker because the lip is white and I probably need to go in and maybe erase some of this. A little bit harder to do here. Just kind of erase is a little bit darker. Okay, because it's kind of the same thing like on this side, right? This is where hair is dark and then this is dark. Then the handle layer is dark, where it there's some highlights here too. You know you can, so for highlights on a cup you can actually just kind of circle it and then shade around it. You can do that. Okay, so this part right here, this is the distinction right here. This is darker. Okay, so that would be a cup. All right, having those sketch lines, it shows you that you're thinking about the process correctly. You're not trying to do this kind of stuff. We don't want to do that. We actually want to be very loose. We want to be able to see things clearly, see things behind and see major curvatures It's okay as long as I have that. So now you can just kind of curve it in. So try to work big. Very important. Leave the strokes big like that. Move your whole arm. Don't just move your wrist. Drawing is a full body sport. Here this side is darker. So, don't worry about that. And yeah, try to draw smaller too. If you're having problems shading, you know, because any, when it comes to shading, the larger the surface, you know, the more hand control you're gonna need because it's a lot harder to shade consistently on a large area. Okay, so lip right here, I can actually exaggerate it a little bit. That'll give you more of a white on the top, so you feel the curvature a little bit more. And right here, it's a little bit darker too. It's around the way. But this part right here is dark, so I'm just gonna push in. And you important, you know, I think the major thing I kind of want to go over with drawing this kind of stuff is kind of beginner lesson. It's like very important to be able to do ellipse, you know, just keep doing that, try to get nice curvatures and draw things behind, you know, this, yeah, you need to be able to show that. So don't be afraid to draw things\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back and this is Wei and welcome to another quick drawing video and Fun is really cool image. I got some nice tone and pretty sexy obviously But the legs got some nice definition to it and I thought it would be a pretty cool Just a fun new exercise just to I guess you know in the mornings right now. I just kind of want to sketch something so let's let, that's a lot of stuff with there Yeah, okay, I won't go much down further. Let, so let's see. The highlight's gonna be right here. So things to identify just right around here. This is the hottest, the brightest spot. And then of course, the lighting is kind of directly in front or slightly up top even though there's a little bit of highlight right here. Check and power bring back with my media eraser. All right maybe too early for erasing so let's keep going first. All right let's just start shading. So right here the muscle kind of tucks in, rolls down. So This part's slightly darker. Darker here. So I'm cross-hatching, I'm doing circles, you know, whatever. I mean, you want just thick with cross-hatching, you can do that too, but sometimes it's nice to just people, you know, come in there can start from there. There's none of this should be as bright as up here. I mean besides, even the highlights on the right here, it's you know, it's darker than this. Right here, this part is gonna be darker. This one looks like it's going back. So let's be fine, this edge right here. Dark here. It's bump here and then this is gonna go out. Okay, so all of this is you guys are too. But whatever you guys do with drawing, just to bring it back you know just so that we get rid of some of the motion there when you have too much directional lines you can start feeling you weight of whatever you're drawing. Especially with anatomy. I do a lot of 3D modeling of the short. Maybe just a little bit. All right. So skip the hard work of shading and we'll just call it a style.fers and that will really help to establish the kind of the base I guess the value the tone\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back to All the Way and for this one, I found this really cool image of Jason which is kind of neat and it's got a lot of dynamic lighting so that kind of motivated me to let's just get this a shot and and also it's a lot of fun I think shading this kind of stuff it just kind of keeps it everything very loose. Alright, so I can't see the tops I'll just kind of the lip and that's how I can measure that one. So same thing here. If I go straight down, this is where the corner of the lip is. So now I know approximately where, how big the lip is gonna be. And let's one. Shadows here comes across. Not that not that fun to shade here All right, so just taking a quick look I think it looks okay. It might be a little bit too slanted, but let's just go for it. Okay All right, so for shading again, this is I'm using the 4b again So let's just go ahead and shading the eyes right here or the eye sockets for the mass Since it's all is kind of cool. Okay, so here's the lip and this part is pretty dark. So this is going to go in. I'll show you that let's go ahead and the lip is really darker here. So let's, let me work on this part. So this lip is darker than the shadow or the other parts in the shade. So I hit that again. Let's push then a little bit lighter. See this part's lighter, corner and left. It's got a lot of little, okay, looks like it's cracks and stuff. So I'm just gonna hit that just really loosely. Okay, so down here, let's just go ahead and continue this. This is really dark down here. Okay, let's come back up here. Now that we have this, let's come going up. I know this is a very strange way of drawing but again, I'm just trying to see different parts of the drawing and whatever I see I'll just try. It doesn't really matter where you are. Especially once you kind of draw in all these like little guidelines already, there's really not much you can do in terms of changing the outlines and details. So right now it's just like that. That's part darker right here. And the light area will fill that in later. I mean there's obviously details in there as well. Right now I'm just kind of concentrating dark here on the dark those professional artists and how they try to come in and say right on, it looks great. It's like me, I'm kind of having to come back in all the time and try to fix little things. So let's try to be a. One little patch comes down. I'm still holding my phone. I really need to get, I actually bought one, a little phone holder. I hopefully just feel this shape a little bit more. The greater the range, the more we can feel the shape. So now I'm seeing this part that's just slightly darker here gonna be a line here and I'm just gonna give this out here even if I do do it, you know, it's like if you look at it, you'll be like, what in the world is that? Right? It just looks weird. So, you know what I mean? I mean, it kind of looks like a collar, but... So, I guess that's one thing. If it looks a little bit strange, you know, in the reference, and if you do draw, just keep in mind that, dark. Dark here, this is white right here. This part's dark. Come in. This part's art. Okay, so I know this is darker and I'm kind of doing way too many strokes right here and it's not going anywhere because this area is so dark. It's in the ear. Let's keep that in mind. Hopefully I can correct that. Alright, so I think that's pretty much it, right? And I mean, there's a lot of little details like the bloods and little cuts. I guess we can try to, yeah and just kinda keep pushing this up to you. Yeah, so I think that's fuzzy. So if I sharpen up this area, I have some small details and stuff. It's gonna draw your eye to it, which is kind of nice in that area. I'm pencil scanning too short. Let's if you if you do sketch from It's because there's a lot of stuff going on and You'll learn a lot more about shadows and stuff Yeah, try not to find find one where it's kind of straight on or or touched up or whatever Stay away from those strong those references They're the worst to work from\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's do another shading exercise and let's go over how you can shape by using these wiggly shapes. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, let's talk about shading methods a little bit more and the shading method I want to talk about is these kind of wiggly shapes. Now for your general shading you should be using cross hatching which is you know just basically making a bunch of hatch lines and then you can cross it kind of shading is really to you know to soften things up a little bit and I know I'm kind of probably going overboard with shading it like this but I just kind of want to show you how how it works so I'm just gonna do like a sphere and this is really good hand control to exercise so I'm gonna try to get it as round little bit more. So a lot of it is hand control. But you know, any kind of shading method you use, it's really going to depend on your hand control anyway. And if you don't have it, just don't worry about it because the more you draw, the better you'll be at it. That's just the push it down even harder. And let's get a little bit more on the edge right here. On the edge, yeah, I probably have to cross hatch a little bit here. You really can't get like a fine line and that's not what this wiggly shaped for anyways. So once I get a little bit harder line, I'm gonna go in and wmpit right here. Okay, and then there's some muscles coming going on. And then here's the bra going up. So let's see. So again, you know, it's just whatever. Just kind of want to get something to shade. All right. So this is kind of the armpit right here and this arm elbow. All right. So let's more wiggly shapes. This bottom part is darker here. Okay, so it's very light. Everything's still very light right now. And with a too much. Hopefully I can get it correct. So here's darker. I'll just kind of run sometimes, especially with these print paper. But it still works. And you can actually get some pretty good realism off of this print paper too, just because it's so smooth. You can actually shade it very lightly. And with a smooth surface, it'll pick up a lot of little marks you I guess I can hit it a little bit harder. These edges, right? Okay, so yeah, try practicing this kind of shading and it's really good. You know, if you, let's say you crosshatch something like this, right, and it's very rough and then you want to clean it up, you know, what you want to do is you can just kind of go in and just kind of wiggle.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let me go over some basic key points and perspective because it's actually very important to be able to visualize the 3D space in whatever it is that you draw. So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, let's go over some basic stuff for perspective and you know perspective can be pretty complicated but for general drawing you know you only really, the order perspective line is going in one direction. So we can do, so all these lines are parallel. And this is kind of like perpendicular, right? So it's perpendicular to the horizon. So let's just connect these lines a little bit, just draw some guidelines. Okay, I'm gonna do another one here. And what this gives you, it's kind of like a three dimensional grid is compared to this, right? But this one feels a lot more, you know, just three dimensional in general. Alright, so let's add one more and this is right. So with three point perspective, here, let's say this is a rooftop, right? So this is two points. And then with three point, we're going to add in this point here. So now we've got to follow these lines. So instead of having a vertical, whereas we have in the two point perspective, in one point, everything was vertical, this one's actually going to move down to do something like this, there are better ways to lay out this kind of perspective and actually using 3D programs. It's a lot easier. So overall, so this will be a one point perspective and this is very simple. When you're drawing, you probably want to make it a little bit more complicated than know, these will pretty much go off the paper. I mean, there's no, you know, the vanishing points too far away, right? Because the perspective is not that steep. So, you kind of want to practice doing these kind of boxes and just kind of try to visualize that all these, it's going to go into, you know, with linear lines, just kind of just go over it, you know, let it go past you, you know, past what you want to draw. And that's really helpful in trying to visualize, that way you can visualize the perspective, right? Because once you extend the lines, then you're going to be able to see, oh, you know, that this is not correct, right? Or the angle is wrong. So like, if I do something like this, now we know, you know, this line doesn't make any sense, right? Because this too is converging here, and these two are going back more. So it's just\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Now if you want to learn how to draw this, it's going to be a very important video for you because I'm going to go over some of the basic ideas of sketching and drawing and I'll be just doing this simple apple but it's going to be very informative and let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way. Alright, so let's draw this apple and one of the things we talk about in our class is always the contour drawing which is actually pretty dry and pretty boring. So with the contour drawing, what they want you to do is because if you look at the apple, it's not quite brown, right? But I can simplify it by being brown, and then the bottom can be another shape like this. So it's kind of overlapping these primitives. So here's the leaf right here, there's a stem. So it's very simple of like the envelope, like this is kind of going, and the reason why they call it the envelope is because you're kind of going around it, you just kind of imagine if there's an envelope all the way, shrinking into the apple, and you're gonna start out with this kind of rougher, this kind of a little bit more angular, you you're able to do the envelopes obviously but you know it just takes time accuracy it takes time if you draw a lot you'll notice that you're getting more and more accurate and you'll be like why is that happening and it's just it's because you know your angles and things like that. So once I corrected this, then obviously the stem is too big, right? Because if you look at the, if you go, if you do this kind of slant, this should, should hit the stem right around here. So now the stem should be there. So it's just like, cross hatch a little bit so I can get a little bit deeper tone and some variation in the shading. Because if I do everything in one direction, what happens is there's a lot, it creates a lot edge so it can get some kind of variation on the lines so that it makes it a little bit more interesting. Looks like it's a little bit more detail. So as I'm shading here, I'm doing some wiggly shapes right here. I'm just kind of wiggle, wiggle. And this is just to kind of fill in the little gaps here and there a little bit. Okay, and then this is much darker. Yeah, that's about it on this apple. All right, so since I have another apple right here, let me shade this with, let's just say, just in one direction, kind of show you how it looks because you guys send the artwork and stuff and this is one of the things I see on some of your shadings. So some of you will shade it this way, I mean, because I've seen people do it as a style. And actually, it's something that I wanted to try eventually. They kind of mess around with this kind of stuff. So you can try to do it in one direction. You could. But it's a lot more hand control. It gets a little bit tricky, but it does kind of create a kind of unique style on its own.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and thanks for joining me here. A lot of you have asked about some of the materials I used. So I'm going to just do a real quick video on some of the drawing materials I used for most of my drawings. And they're basically these Stiegler graphite pencils. And they're made in Germany. They're pretty good quality. Actually, they're very good quality. And it's about like a buck 50 each, but they do last for quite a while. So it is good. Good one. So if you wanna go really dark, then you're gonna have to use the 6B. Now, the HB, which is kind of like, I don't actually don't have an HB, but I have a B, which I don't have in pencil form, but I have a B. That is pretty close to your regular, what's that? Scoop pencil, the yellow one that you guys use. Is it a with this. That's because it's much harder pencil compared to the higher numbers. So just let me sketch this and I'm sketching in as quickly as I can. And you decent, you know, you can get a pretty good range with this. All right, so I'm gonna do, that was a 2B. So I'm gonna switch to the 4B, this is a 4B now. And I'm gonna do this, one edge is always going to get flattened out. So you want to sharpen, you just kind of turn it a little bit and you get a nice sharp edge. And then this is dark right here. I'm going to make this. All right. So the 6B is actually really cool. You can sketch really fast this way. And that's because it's a lot softer, so you can end up covering a lot of areas a lot faster. Here is thes off really. So it's actually more expensive to use. I mean, if money is an issue for a pencil. So yeah, it does rub off a little faster. If you do buy these pencils, you might want to get a couple of result, this kind of darkness on a 6B. So, well, since this is kind of like somewhere in the middle, I'm going to use the 2B and the 6B on this just to finish things out. And so you can see, you know, if you use a combination of pencils, how much more variety you can get in 2B. And this helps to fill in the areas a little bit cleaner, the lighter areas. Mostly small details, like really good for these eyelashes. And then I'll switch back, let's say, to the 4B just to let's say I want to fill in, you know, around the eye. Well, let's use the to be, I'm just gonna switch to four B, and then just kinda lay it in able to do this kind of stuff more freely and it gives you a little bit more weight. So actually having a longer pencil really helps. At least that's what I find. What you don't want to do is you don't want to like cringe like this onto be able to just keep sketching. You don't have to sharpen them. Now if you do want to sharpen these, they have these mechanical pencil sharpeners. And basically, you just extend your lead, you put them in here, and you just kind of rotate and grind the lead. And it would give you a nice sharp edge.\", 'Art'], [\" Alright, welcome back and this morning I want to talk about actually something pretty important and I just kind of want to share with you the way I sketch and the way I see certain things and how I can translate what you what I see on to paper and I'm just kind of Giquing out right here with my star trek her costumes book and it's got some pretty good imagery So I'm just would be the slant of this If I were to roughly sketch this I would draw a slant like this first and then here's the oval and then here's the neck and then here's the face All right, and then from here then I would kind of middle, right right here. And things we can pick up is like, here is the highlight for the face right here. There's the light coming over this side and then one on the side. And right here is all dark about halfway to the lower lip and then slightly higher for the lip line. So again, halfway, slightly higher. So this lip should be right around here. I mean, approximately. And again, you see me do this a lot, judging from the angles to get the corner of the nose and things like that. Another image. So that kind of give us the little shoulder pad right here. And then this angle going back up. Then we'll try and go here and then the arm. Let's just continue this little part here. This little space in here. And then his hand, this glove, can be, if you judge it from the bottom of the disc space right here. This nose is about half. And then another half for the lip. Again, really rough because he's got a little goatee here, this little mustache. It's so soft. Okay, so we can keep going and, you know, that right here. So it's going this way. So you want to make sure you get that. This line is almost kind of almost vertical actually comes out like this. So it's a little angle like that. And I'm just trying to show you what I'm seeing. Turns out what I'm drawing. So again, it's this is just like a little bell shape. And then here's the slant of this curve, curve, slant. And then the legs are coming down here, here. So here's the dress for the legs. So here's, if you divide up this line here, here's the middle. So I know it's gonna be slightly over to the right. here. I know this is really strange. I'm starting from the bottom to the top, but it really doesn't matter. My the middle line here. And then for arm, elbows right around here where the hand is. So I know it's down here. So now that we know the elbows here, we can just kind of, it's almost like connecting. We can actually just connect that. Okay legs, highlights here, here. Okay. Yeah, I mean, the proportion again is a little bit off because it's kind of speeding through here. It actually needs to go up. Okay. So it should be like that. And then the son of this arm. So I have the forearm. Okay. And when you're drawing this,. And then, here's the lower arm. Right around the belt area. It's gonna back up here. So now that I have these lines, this one's dark. I really should sharpen my pencil, see the lighting is pretty flat. The clothing right here, right from here, come straight down. Line, the name, there's the badge. So there's not much interesting stuff here to shade. Okay, right at the elbow. See this of fun. It's kind of flat but it actually looks like Spock so that's really good. Alright, so I think that's about it. I filled up this piece of paper and I just if there's a line here, where's the center point? Just little things like that really helps. Where's the center point? If a line here, where's the three quarter point? Maybe like here? If the center's here, I can check it real quick. So center center. So that's a little bit off, but close enough. And that's the whole point. Start visualizing things and\", 'Art'], [\" Hey guys, welcome back to all the way and for this one I'm just gonna be drawing a lip and Actually a very nice smile. Let's see if you guys can figure out who it is and in general, you know It will be kind of a good exercise to draw just kind of mouth and teeth Let's try this out. Let's see if you guys have problem with teeth. And I do because what happens is if you draw too many or if you draw in kind of like underneath here is always darker, right? Because it's tucking in. So you can go ahead and make this part darker. And then I'm just gonna this one shade. And you see this kind of shading. It's kind of like, let's see, I can do it over here. Try to practice this kind of shading. Like if you have a box right here, try to practice this kind of stuff. Or you kind of learn how to stop where you is so important. So hopefully I'll get some of that. So here's the highlight. I'll exaggerate this edge right here, that way I can get a little bit more contrast right here so that you can feel like there's a highlight here, just like right here. If I exaggerate this edge, that. We can always come back in and make it darker. I like... Okay, so this is gonna be the corner. Okay, I'll extend out a little bit more so we can get more of the smile in. I mean, I'll shade around the face. But let little bit darker in here, obviously. So this is a little bit off, but it's okay. Let's just keep going. So certain parts right here, like the canine, a little bit more angular. Come here. So that's it. A lot start here this line because it's actually a little bit, as this folds out, it kind of strains up a little bit so it can catch just a little bit more shadow. And then there's always a light right here because this inside edge as it grows away. I should switch to a 6B, I mean a 4B. Let's just keep going with this. So the bottom row of teeth, I'm just gonna leave it a little bit dark like that. I don't think we want to see those too much right? Because we have the top teeth already. So this is very dark. Yeah, let's try, yeah, it's kind of hard to tell, obviously, who it is. Let me go in and continue around it so we can get the feel of the smile a little bit more. So here's the middle, here's the highlight. There's always highlight right here because it catches the light. Here's the nose up here. I won't draw the nose, but shading right here, but it's not a line, right? I mean, it's just a very sharp crease, so just kind of remember that. And that's why I'm going lightly on this, because I don't want to hit it too hard, because I up drawing the whole lower part of face. So let's see, it's a highlight here. There's the 6B. I don't know if you can know who it is. It is Jessica Alba, of course, a very beautiful smile. And she does have a very unique smile. That's why I chose her. Hopefully that you guys can actually recognize her. But then I don't think I've drawn it that accurately, at least. So, okay. So just some general things. Maybe that's a little too much. A little bit too hard. Okay, I just stabbed it away go in and I don't know, maybe shading more around it or I don't know, adding some more detail here and there.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, welcome back and this is Wei and let's draw this little metallic bow which has some interesting properties and let's try to shade and see if we can get this shiny look to it which is kind of kind of cool for able to do it. Alright, so to begin let's just go ahead and roughen the shape of the bow real quick. So we're kind of seeing it on the top a'm seeing the darkest spot looks like right at the rim right here. So let's just get that in there. So I'm turning my pencil to get this is brush metal so it's got a kind of like a brush effect going this way but I'm just gonna shade it like this first. I can always add that in later I think. Or if I most of this is kind of like, obviously, gray, but this one, I don't know, it's hard to judge maybe like a 30 This thing comes around, let's shade this. Okay, and then right here in the bottom, there's another kind of light-up patch right here the right. So you can get little shades like that. And that's how you can shade things like this. So the darkest part is always when course these are this one is obviously like a studio shot of a product and that's where the lights are right here. this side. Gets lighter right here. Okay, now I'm coming back here now. Let's see, the hair's all highlight here. So let's step that out. And a little bit more contrast right here. Help bottom looks a little bit easier. Well, less complicated, but at the same time, you know, let's visually and it's a little bit harder to see, you know, to try to make it, you know, metallic. So actually having things to shade up here, like this is actually slightly darker as well. Very little, but it's enough to, you know, get this bottom here a little bit more shape. And let's erase this out so I can get a little bit more light here. So sometimes it's very subtle. So I'm really light on my pencil. I'm barely touching's kind of finalize. I think a lot of it's just moving out at this point. I think I got You know most of the major Elements in so it's just a matter of going in and seeing like this part here gets really dark That's gonna help bring out to bring out this highlight bit. Darker up here, dark right here, really dark right here in the bottom. Clean up this highlight a little bit to make the dark areas and then just kind of go you know area by area just hit the dark areas first and then just just whatever you know go work working whatever direction you want alright so yeah now I'm seeing all this stuff and I gotta tell myself to stop alright so hope you guys enjoy this little video so remember what whenever you join\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and welcome back. Let's draw some key parts and this would be a very important fundamental lesson in drawing So let's get started and I'll talk about the process along the way Alright, so let's draw some key parts and this one is fairly simple. Actually, all of them are gonna be relatively simple So with this kind of shit what you can do is I know it's like a dome But you can actually start out like a circle even simplify even more, you know, like let's let's go with the back too. And then here's a little... I don't know, I guess for the lid. So let's see here. Here's the... How many colors? The spout. We call this... The part where the T comes up. Whatever it is called. I think it's called spout. So it's kind of like a... You notice I'm drawing this, right? Because this is kind of cylindrical shapes right here where it meets, connects to the mouth, just about. And then, I don't know if we even shade it. All right, let's just shade it. So right now I'm just kind of looking at this. There's the lid. And this is gonna be rough, because I just kind of wanna, in terms of shading, you can spend more time just a little lip. Here's a little highlight right here. So we're gonna make this real dark right here. We're shading in here. And again, these are things where you know, it's like if you look at it, you know, there's so much things, so much areas little bit. It's kind of lower. So it cuts in like this. And here's the handle. Now there's a lot of detail on the handle. So I'm just going to sketch in the overall shape first. It's basically like a, oh it's like a square-ish tube. Okay. So I, here's a little lip here. Comes up, here's a little metal piece that comes out. Comes up and then here's a little, whatever you call it, a little hinged thing going on, all right? Okay, and then let's see, that's about it, right? You see how simple these shapes are. It's like you put them all together and it just turns into something. All right, so let's shade it that dark. All right. There's a little highlight here, right? This lip here is dark here. It comes down. And then this part right here is, if you look at it carefully, you know, there's this part here is dark and then this is darker and then this is slightly darker. So here's one. Let's see. And then this one is kind of darker. Let's see, how the light is playing on the surface. Once you recognize that, then you can go in and shade it. Okay, then this is darker on the bottom. The bottom lip is darker, and then this is for a little bit darker here too. So I'm kind of seeing things inot. All right, let's do this last one here. And this one's a little bit more complicated. The shading is more complicated, but also there's a lot of kind of little things going on here too. So all right, let's just do the body. So it's kind of like an so everything fits in frame. So I'm just gonna do this. And then just give us some volume. So you can start out as a wire, just start a little wire around it and just give us some volume. And again, accuracy is not what I made me here so again I'm drawing over it you see how I'm going right over this little area right here because you know it's really rough like this, as long as you get the values correct, even though it's blocky shading, it actually still comes alive. And that's the cool part about this kind of shading. This highly reflective surfaces. Okay, make this a little bit darker. Let's follow that a little bit more. So I get a nice reflection here. So you can start feeling the roundness of this, right? So this is a reflective light down here. And so it's a little bit lighter. Okay, so I think this part is coming along. So right here is darker, darker. Okay this whole bottom part is kind of darker, right? So I'm just gonna give it one light shape first. Some details here and then here I can just kind of do a shortcut. I'm just kind of just shading this because it's mainly black, right? So these are a ways that you can simplify things and just kind of\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, welcome back and this is Wei and let's go ahead and draw something pretty simple I'm just gonna draw this little bow right here and it's a very good little exercise so hopefully I'll get a little bit more warmed up with this kind of simple drawings. Alright, so I'm just gonna use a 2B so it's not too light, not too dark. So for the bow itself, this part is always a little bit tricky. Let down so that I actually turn my paper here. Because sometimes it's a little bit easier if you can just turn your paper so whichever way you feel more comfortable drawing. Alright, so that's the top. Let's go ahead and draw the bottom. So let's just give it one shade first and then we'll refine everything else. Okay, so for the shading, I'm just doing... Just little hatch lines you feel like it's getting a little bit too dull and a little bit too muddy up. Alright, let's get back to this. So right here, so I'm turning my pencil so I can get like a little be right around here. And the reason this part is the darkest, because this is the lightest. So when we see it, there's going to be the most contrast right here. So I'm just going to start right here. So this will be a little bit darker. So on the edge right here, it looks like it's a little bit easier when you hold it, when your pencil is a lot longer, you're able to make these kind of long lines a little bit easier. So that's kind of how you can do this here. I mean, you can switch the way you hold your pencil too. I know a lot of fine artists do that. They actually hold it like this, but I don't know. Let's see what happens. Let's push the 2B a little bit further along first. Okay, so right here again, it's the contrast from the dark and white. So we'll soften that edge a little bit. Okay. So this edge is white and the only way we're gonna like, you know, shade it as you see the heart in art Just trying to make it a little bit more artistic I'm not trying to do a I mean, I want to realistic but I don't want to go for the hyper stuff Because the I mean, there's a little bit softer here. Let's get this edge right here on the top. So you can leave these kind of cross-hatching lines. It doesn't have to be smooth. It's kind of nice that way. I this part looks weird, but it does give a nice white edge right over here on the bow, which is what we wanted to achieve. So this nice in that respect. So we can come all the way down and then let's go ahead and just darken up the shadow just a little bit more much, I guess a little bit too much, but let me shade that in. Actually use a 2B. So I took out a little bit too much, I'm just gonna put it back in. Okay, yeah, it's messy because I'm using the soft pencil, but you can see that, right? Now it feels like the light's here, bouncing, bouncing. So it just up a little bit. I see this part a little bit darker. All these little things are coming in view. I think that's about it. I mean, any more from this point is really It's a good nice little practice. I haven't done this for a long time. So let's shade this in. Nice little, nice little morning sketch.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, this is Wei and thanks for joining me here once again. Now for this video I'm gonna be drawing a cube and then we're gonna add in a light source and then from the light source we're gonna shade the cube. And these kinds of exercises will help you understand how light interacts with surfaces so that eventually you'll be able to draw whatever you want and then shade it without using any kind of reference. So let's get started and I you know, you can go like this. It's like the more your arms moving, you know, the straighter, the better the line quality will be. And actually I talk about that right for this cube, what you want to do is just envision the light source coming here. I'm just going to take any point and I'm going to hit this surface right here. So let out perfectly white. And as your light source move up, you're going to hit it here so your angle is going to get wider and wider. And the wider it is the less light it's going to get. So that means it's going to be darker. So you can envision this angle right here. So obviously it's not a 90 degree angle. So that means this is going to get a little bit of shading. it as a start. Because we could always go darker, but we can't go lighter, right? OK. So now we have basically a one, two, what a lot of people call one, two, and three. Because it's one, two, and three. Because you have three different values on the surface. So let's make this's see, let me sketch right here real quick. So like if you have a cube like this, right, what we have, to figure out a shadow, what you want to do is just envision, you just have like three, like poles, you know, at the corner. And point. Now you can use a ruler to get like a much straighter line, but I'm just kind of eyeballing it because it's whatever, I'm just trying to illustrate the point. So from here, the top, casting probably off. So let's just say somewhere right here. So now we have that point. And same thing here. Let's see. We need to get this stick. So you've got to kind of visualize how it is in there. Now, a quicker way to do it, because we know this is parallel again. So we're just going to go this. Get this point here. The cast shadow is the darkest part. Let's see, let's do that. Now that we have the shadow in, it kind of brings everything into play right now you feel like this thing is cubed is actually sitting there. And that I can take a eraser and make this part a little bit lighter. Or I can just make the top here, a little bit darker. So now you get this, see by making this top edge darker, now there bit darker, I mean, a lighter. And now you can start to feel that there's, you know, some kind of light play around this area. Okay. Now same thing right here on this side. This is, actually this area is not get a lot of bounce light, right? Because this is actually pretty bright. So you can either make this license real technical about this and actually start to measure the angles and give a certain value if you want to get into pretty much it. It's pretty fun to do. And this is very good practice. So let me do another real quick example as to how you can put this kind of stuff in when you're drawing But not a slightly bigger than a 90 degree angle. So these two areas are going to be in the shade in right here. So to compensate I can make this area a little bit darker. Okay, so now it looks like you know this one is not as dark. Okay, so we do that. 1, 2, so 1, 2, 3 and this will be 1, 2 and 3. So make this slightly darker just to give it a little bit more contrast. Okay. So that's pretty cool.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey everyone, welcome back and I know it's been a while since my last video So let's draw something a little bit easier. I'm just gonna show you guys how to draw and shade a cone and I realized I haven't drawn that one I know I draw in a cylinder and circle and in a cube I haven't done a cone so cone is actually very easy to draw it's almost basically like Like a cylinder, but this up a little bit, and that's gonna give us a comb. Or, so you can draw it in any kind of direction. Let's say you have maybe a easy. So it's just right in the center right here. So that shading the cone, it's actually drawing shading on the top right here. Okay, so that's gonna be the front and then now for the back. So whatever light you have here, so even darker just depends on how much bounce light you want to do. Let's just smooth this out around here, do this. So that's the key part about shading a cone. It's up here, because a lot of time what happens is that, you know, when you guys shade the top, you shade like this, and then you're very important to kind of understand just kind of be able to freehand it. I guess when you draw a lot of stuff it's really just made up of a lot of basic shapes anyway. Alright so that's it for this tutorial on how to draw and shade the cone. It's very basic but yeah very\", 'Art'], [\" Hey, this is Wei with AutoWay.com. So in this video, let me show you how you can draw some, you know, decent circles and also some nice curvature, nice arcs with your wrists. Because, you know, whatever drawing you're going to do, there's always going to be some kind of curvature to it. So the better control you have in drawing circles and arcs, the more professional you're drawing is going to look. So let me show you some exercises's how you do circles. Just don't try to do it with one stroke. Just keep going, you know. Just keep it light. It's very loose. Now this is a very basic thing arc, right? So if I want to go this way, I can swing this way. So if I want to make a tighter arc, I can just tuck my pencil in a little bit more. But just be careful, you don't want to tuck it in too close. So you can get a nice little arc. Now if you can do is you can turn the paper and then get to the directions so they can go like this. And you see a lot of artists do that. They'll constantly be turning the paper in order to get to that position, which is fine. So practice on just swinging your arm, your wrist, the saddest and the most natural position.\", 'Art'], [\" Hey guys, welcome back and I know it's been a while and I've been watching the high series from Netflix and it's actually okay Actually finished season one right there. I'm gonna give up on it cuz I got tired of the story because it kind of it never ends But I do like the mask design and let's just go ahead and have a little fun speed things along a little bit too fast alright and then the lips right here again very strange shape so kind of really have to look at the reference you can't you can't try to you know just kind of make it up because it's not a real face okay so here's the cheekbone. So this is round here, so this part's gonna be a little bit darker on the bottom. Okay, so this is kind of like envision an egg shape. Okay, I'm looking up at the camera as out on the tip. All right, and then see, let's try on the eyebrows. So really the nose, you have very strange shapes. Okay. So now that we's right here. And then the mustache, let's see. It's such a geometric shape too light. So I'm just gonna try be pretty much dark. It's not really too interested doing that. I like to keep the focus here. And then this part you know, you know, have a different kind of storyline, right? So how long you gonna do the mint thing the whole time? So it started, started out good and then it just kinda got tired of it. Actually, you know what, most start out with the basic shape and then once you see what the highlights are, try to visualize that this is one egg shape. So that's why this part down here is just dark and you just kind of go and just give it a one quick shape first. So you're shading this thing first, this whole big shape and then you can come back and say, okay, you know, this part right here goes in. So you're gonna come in and make that a little bit darker.\", 'Art'], [\" Welcome back and this morning let's draw something a little bit different. Let's draw some cartoons and This one's gonna be based on Spongebob Squarepants. I think we've all kind of watch it. You know great little cartoons So in terms of drawing cartoons It's actually a very good way to learn how to sketch because we're forced to see you know very basic shapes obviously and it's actually very very useful in drawing Alright, so let's try this out and let correct this real quick. Should be a little bit longer, I think. Okay, and then the bottom here, this is basically, this is a cube here, and this is gonna slam back. Okay, and then it's legs gonna be here. Well, let's just skip all the way around here. This is a little bit straight. It's pretty flat. So if I draw a line like that, this upper mouth is gonna be right there. So again, leave these lines, it'll help. And then here, right, if you come down, you visualize where his mouth's gonna be right here of the lines. I notice my nose is off. I guess it should be a little bit higher because it should be right underneath the eyes. So something is off here. Maybe my eyes too small. Maybe this needs to be a little bit bigger because I shouldn't see the bottom of this eye right here. Or maybe it's his face. The features and now I'm just gonna come all the way around with a wavy line here. I'm not gonna try to match it. So whatever. So that other one. So again, we can draw on a shape like this, and then we can clean it up. Here's his arm coming out from here it turns, and then ultimately it turns into something. Because they've drawn so much that they can draw the skeleton and they can draw the basic shapes really, really fast. And if you draw any kind of cartoon, long enough, you'll be able to develop that. It's very easy, actually. Okay, so it's not coming in. I mean, come down and if this guy go out, comes back. It's a little bit flatter here. Okay, yeah, so very, very simple and then I like in here. Yeah, so that's Spongebob, hopefully. Well, it artist and things like that. But let's just try it this way. I'll just draw a cone like this and then I'll simplify the shapes. So from here, here's this bottom. So I come down. Oh yeah, actually this should go first. Like a circle like this. And that's probably better, like and I would be able to draw from memory. And it's actually pretty fun, you know, you just go ahead and draw it. It's like so fast. I think I can actually try it later. you. You're drawing a lot more lines, but somewhere in there is going to be the line that you want. And by drawing that, you can much nicer curve. It's notice in the slant and everything. So the corner mouse I higher. So in order to clean out these curves, what you want to instead of drawing one line like this, what I'll do is I'll draw multiple lines. And then here, maybe even just halfway, give us a cleaner curve. Almost like a flicking motion here, because it's so long, just going to let it taper out. And then let's see, we're going to finish up the bottom. So same thing here. You can keep going, keep going, keep going. Hopefully we'll be accurate after a while. Just a great exercise to be able to do this anyways. Okay, and then, so like the pattern, we can simplify, we can draw this first, and then in here we things like that. Okay, so this was kind of fun. I mean, I haven't drawn this for a long time. So the character really like it was screw. I don't know if I can still draw it. I mean, just draw it quickly. Oh my God, maybe I don't remember. He's got a big nose. Two eyes and then... I can't remember. I can't remember how it looks like.\", 'Art'], [\" American psychologist and professor of psychiatry K.

And as you probably guessed, this can be pretty tough terrain to explore. These disorders can take people from terrifying which is not to say that it isn't serious, but it's common and it's pervasive, and it's the top reason people seek out mental health help. We've all felt down before, obviously, often in response to a specific loss, a breakup or a lost job or the way your body runs itself. Plus, in keeping with our definition of psychological disorders to be considered a true disorder, this behavior needs to cause the person or others around them prolonged distress, the feeling that something is really wrong. Just as a person with severe generalized anxiety disorder may never want to leave the house, a clinically depressed person often feels so hopeless colony. In other words, bad judgment is common. And it can get worse. Full blown manic episodes often end up in psychiatric hospitalization since the risk to self or others can become severe. When the highs eventually end, they're often followed by dark periods of depression. When left untreated suicide or suicide attempts are common, another element of the disorder that Jameson herself can attest to. Like with a return to baseline, healthy functioning. Worldwide, women tend to be diagnosed with major depression more often than men, but many psychologists think this is simply because women tend to seek treatment more. It's also possible that depression in men tends to manifest itself more in terms of anger and aggression than as sadness and hopelessness. This is just an example of how depression is much more than just being sad, and that the characteristic lack of purpose and hopelessness can manifest itself in a lot of different ways often view bad events through an internal lens or mindset that influences how they're interpreted, and how you explain events to yourself in a negative or positive way can really affect how you recover from them or don't. Say you were humiliated in the lunch room when someone tripped you and your chicken soup flew all over the place and you sat down on a brownie and it was just a bad day. A depressive mind might immediately start thinking that the humiliation will last forever, that no one will ever let you live\", 'Psychology'], [\" What do you see in this image? A scary face, a couple of squirrels fighting? For this one, a squashed frog or tumbling poodles of bleeding bats? Herman Rorschach wants to know. He wanted to know. He's dead now. He believed that your answers, what you saw in the ink, said something about your personality. Rorschach was a Swiss psychoanalyst who, in his youth, was fascinated by the childhood game of making pictures out of ink blots called klexography. As an adult, Rorschach was is one of the many methods psychologists have used in an ongoing quest to understand personality. And of all the concepts we cover in this course, personality is one of the most complex and one of the most contested. This is where we bring in the household names, not just Rorschach but Freud and Jung, as well as other influential thinkers like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers. It's where some of the most familiar concepts in early psychology come into play, ones that people with even passing knowledge of the field have heard of. The ego, the Oed characteristics and how do they combine to make me, me, and you, you? And guess what? As you might expect, there are a number of competing perspectives on personality theory. Four, to be exact. The first and one of the most influential has been the psychoanalytic perspective, first championed by our coke-loving cigar-chewing, ran to Sigmund Freud. It was through his clinical observation of patients that Freud came to theorize the existence of the unconscious. For id, your unconscious, primitive, and instinctive self. Freud thought the id was all about sex and aggression, the so-called pleasure principle of immediate gratification. To him, infants were all id. That's in part why babies freak out when they don't get a snack look right now, instead of just taking a deep breath for a second. For that matter, a lot of the off-the-wall celebrities their work. Regression, for example, involves a retreat to a more infantile, psychosexual stage, like when a second grader sucks their thumb when they're nervous. Reaction formation is kind of like passive aggression. It involves flipping unacceptable impulses, like the desire to punch someone in the face with their opposites, like offering cookies with a fake smile. Projection is when you disguisesensitive areas. Infants start out in the oral stage because they get pleasure from eating, from there, child enters the anal stage focused on peeing and pooping, then on the phallic stage as they discover their boy and girl bits. It was during this stage that Freud believed the infamous Oedipus complex reared up characterized by a boy experiencing a form of sexual envy, which she thought was more than a little insulting to women. She actually proposed that womb envy may occur as much in men who are envious they can't give birth. She encouraged patients to take charge of their own mental health and engage in self-help and analysis, believing people were often able to sort of be their own therapist. We mentioned Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst. Jung because they explored ways in which our mental life and personality may be submerged beneath the veil of consciousness. But the psychoanalytical approach is only one perspective on what makes us who we are. Rather than focusing on how messed up we can be, humanistic theorists focus on the basic goodness of people and how they strive to achieve their full potential. In other words, they believe in the potential for personal growth. Abraham Mas be afraid to be themselves or make mistakes. And the third requirement, according to Rogers, is empathy, or the ability to share others' feelings and reflect their meanings. Rogers thought of these traits as the nutrients required to make a personality grow into a healthy, self-concept that mix of thoughts and feelings that answer the fundamental question, who am I?

But it's important to realize that your intuition isn't always right. In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers of false intuition. If you do getting alternating heads and tails. But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as is streaking. Thus, giving that result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have. That is why we have the methods in safeguards of psychological research and experimentation and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds from language to report them with. So, for example, defining exactly what you mean by thinking better with your espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment. And replication is key. You can want a person to exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much, but if you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you manipulate or control the situation. So yeah, basically just spying on people. Like case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they're very limited in explaining it. Psychologist can also collect behavioral data to look at how one trait or behavior is related to another, or how they correlate. So let's get back to my buddy Bob, who seems to think that his refrigerator is actually some kind of time machine that can preserve food indefinitely. Let's say the Bob is just tucked into a lunch of questionable left findings, but that can only take you so far. To really get to the bottom of cause and effect behaviors, you're gonna have to start experimenting. Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you canable prediction. Remember, keep it clear, simple, and eloquent so that it can be replicated. Caffeine makes me smarter, is not a great hypothesis. A tested it.

She was exhausted after a long and terrible day and just wanted to get home to a hot bath. She was driving down the street, flipping through radio stations when she pulled up to a stop sign and saw something weird.

Bernice was pretty shaken up, but she made sure the driver was okay and then she called the police.

Kearney's had to notice in code, store, and later consciously retrieve This kind of recall is sometimes referred to as context-dependent memory. Say you're reading in bed, and you want to underline a quote, but you don't have a pen. Well, you get up and you go to the other room to find your special light-up Hello Kitty pen, but a few hours later, you're at the store, you realize, you'll have to at home. You'd be more likely to recall the first items on the list, bananas and bread, and the last items, pickles and cheese, than anything in the middle. This is known as the serial position effect. This might be because the early words benefited from what's known as the primacy effect, and made it into your long-term memory because they were rehearsed, Beyonce, and bananas, but she didn't encode much about the driver or the color of the thief's shoes. But again, even memories that have been encoded are still vulnerable to storage decay or natural forgetting over time. Interestingly, even though we can forget things pretty quickly, the amount of data that we forget can actually if you start studying Spanish, it may interfere with the French that you've already learned. There's a lot of reconstruction and inferring involved when you try to flesh out a memory, and every time you replay it in your mind or relate it to a friend, it changes. Just a little. So, in a way, we're all sort of perpetually rewriting our past. While this is an inevitable part of human nature, it can prove dangerous at forget or mis-recall the source of a memory. In the case of Bernice, when she saw the suspect in the courtroom, she thought she recognized him from the night of the crime, when in reality, he just served a coffee earlier that day. But her memory of the event had probably already been tweaked several times before she even made it into the courtroom. Like, she relived the tale multiple times in her own mind in which she told other people about it, and every time she introduced errors filling in memory gaps we tell ourselves. If you haven't forgotten already today, you learned about how our memories are stored in webs of association aided by retrieval cues and priming and influenced by context and mood.

Mike now sleeps in zipped up mummy bags for his own safety. consciousness, meaning it's different than hibernation, being an agoma, or, in, say, an anesthetic oblivion. Although we spend about a third of our lives sleeping, and we know that it's essential to our health and survival, there still isn't a scientific consensus for why we do it. Part of it probably has to do with simple recuperation, allowing our neurons and other cells to rest and repair themselves. Sleep also supports growth, because that's when our pituitary glands release growth hormones, which is why babies sleep all the now call REM, or rapid eye movement, a perplexing period when the sleeping brain is buzzing with activity, even though the body is in a deep slumber. Asurinsky and his colleague Nathaniel Klytman went on to become pioneers of sleep research. Since then, sleep specialists armed with similar technology have shown that we experience four distinct stages of sleep, each defined by unique brainwave patterns. Say just go on to bed. All day, your endocrine system has been releasing awake hormones like cortisol. But REM sleep. That famous stage of sugarplums slumber that makes eyeballs go nuts grants vivid visual dreams and provides the namesake for certain famous rock bands. REM sleep is kind of paradoxical. Your motor cortex is jumping all over the place, but your brainstem is blocking those messages, leaving your muscles so relaxed that you're basically paralyzed. Except for your eyes rare, but you probably know someone with sleep apnea, the disorder that causes sleepers to temporarily stop breathing until their decreased oxygen levels wake them up.

The volunteers didn't realize that the draw was fixed so that they'd always be the teacher while Milgram delivering the maximum 450-volt shock. All of the volunteers continued to at least 300 volts. Over years, Milgram kept conducting this experiment, changing the situation in different ways to see if it had any effect on people's obedience. What he repeatedly found was that obedience was highest social norms. During the early 1950s, Polish-American psychologists Solomon Ash expressed the power of conformity through a simple test.

It has different meanings for different cultures and ages not based on those different aptitudes or would it be more accurate to measure my brain power on several different scales? Around the turn of the 20th century British psychologist Charles Spearman suggested that yes, we do have one comprehensive general intelligence that underlies identify seven clusters of mental abilities. By this system, you might turn on to be great at verbal comprehension, but less stellar at something like numerical ability. Sounds fair. But when researchers followed up on his findings, they actually did see that high scores in one aptitude usually meant good scores in the others, essentially backing up also linked by some underlying general intelligence factor. So what about other less tangible forms of intelligence, like creativity, our ability to produce ideas that are both novel and valuable? How could a test that demands one correct answer account for more creative solutions? So chasing thugs and generally courting danger, Sherlock routinely seeks new experiences, tolerates risk, and perseveres in overcoming obstacles. And everyone knows he's driven by intrinsic motivation.

And finally, emotional intelligence also means using emotions to enable adaptive or creative thinking, like knowing how to manage conflict or comfort-agrieving friend or work well with others. been in a classroom, and teachers wanted to figure out how they could identify kids who needed extra help. Enter Alfred Binet and Theodore Simone, two French psychologists who were commissioned to develop a test to measure a child's so-called mental age. The concept of a kid's mental age is essentially the level of performance associated But his little sister, Betty, is a four-year-old with a mental age of five, so her IQ would be 125. That formula works pretty well for measuring kids, but it falls apart when it comes to adults who don't hit measurable developmental steps like kids do. I mean, there's no real difference between a mental age of 34 and 35. But Stanford professor Lewis and his cronies took the idea of intelligence testing the even darker conclusions. The Nazis were all about selecting against so-called feeble-mindedness and other undesirable traits as they sought to strengthen what they saw as their Aryan nation. They sterilized or simply executed hundreds of thousands of victims based on their answers to IQ test questions that were really more about adhering to social norms than measuring actual intelligence.

When they're not getting the better of us, they have work still puzzling out exactly how they fit together. How do thinking and feeling interact? Which one comes first? And do these bodily reactions, the pounding heart, that, for example, you feel sad because you are crying, or you're scared because you're shaking like leaves. This idea was also proposed by Danish psychologist Carl Longa, and so this concept that physiological arousal precedes emotion is called the James Longa theory. But American physiologist Walter Cannon wasn't feeling it. He thought that too many of the must both feel physiological arousal and cognitively label that arousal. And again, please remember that in psychology, arousal is different from how you're used to using it. Here, arousal can be thought of as activation or stress or even energy, an increase in reactivity or wakefulness that primes us for some kind of action. So sometimes arousal can spill over from one event to the next. Say you just watched a heated soccer match and you're all rev is racing and his cheeks are all flushed.

Maybe because it's pretty rare, affecting about 1% of the population, schizophrenia causes more anxiety in the media, in the public, and even in doctors' offices than any other mental illness. As a result, its sufferers have often been shunned, abused, or locked up. And among the many fallacies that surround the disorder is simply what it means. The word schizophrenia literally means split mind. But contrary to popular belief, the condition has nothing may be the ability to focus on one thing while filtering others out. In extreme cases, speech may become so fragmented it becomes a little more than a string of meaningless words, a condition given a name that sounds like its own kind of non-sequitur word salad. Classic schizophrenia is also often marked by delusions or false beliefs not based in reality. These delusions can be rooted in ideas of grandeur, like I'm the queen of Englandor. I want an Olympic gold medal with their illness, but also made fantastic creative contributions to the world. Many people with schizophrenia also suffer from perceptual disturbances or sensory experiences that come without any apparent sensory stimulation, like hallucinations. This is when a person sees or hears something that isn't there, often lacking the ability to understand what is real and what isn't. Auditory hallucinations or hearing voices are the most common form, and these voices are often abusive. Negative symptoms refer to those that subtract from normal behavior, like a reduced ability to function, neglect of personal hygiene, lack of emotion, toneless voice, expressionless face, or withdrawal from family and friends. Finally, disorganized symptoms are those jumbles of thought or speech that could include word salad and other problems with attention and organization. Symptoms like these are useful in diagn problems with one part of the brain, but abnormalities in several areas and their interconnections. But what might be causing these abnormalities? Earlier I mentioned how a stressful event might trigger psychotic symptoms for the first time, even though it can't actually create the understand, but maybe even more rare and more elusive are the dissociative disorders. These are disorders of consciousness, called dissociative because they're marked by an interruption in conscious awareness. Patients can become separated from the thoughts or feelings that they used to have, which to Handyman, Sid, to the religious and critical Clara. The book became a craze, and within a few years reported cases of multiple personalities skyrocketed from scarcely 100 to nearly 40,000. Many believe the book was essentially responsible for creating a new psychiatric diagnosis. It turns out, though, Civil Story was a big, fat lie. Yes, Shirley Mason was a real person and one with a troubled, traumatic anxiety, a sort of extreme coping mechanism. Either way, the debate and the research continue. Today, we talked about the major symptoms associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including disorganized thinking, inappropriate emotions and behaviors and disturbed perceptions. We also discussed brain activity associated with these disorders and talked about their possible origins, including the diathesis stress model. You also learned about dissociative disorders and dissociative identity disorder in particular.\", 'Psychology'], [\" Let me get your mind right about hypnosis. First of all, it's a real thing, but it's probably not what you think it is. All kinds of hypnosis-esque practices have been around for centuries, but these states aren't as uncommon as you might think. In fact, you've probably experienced an altered state yourself. Even if you've never taken an illicit drug or beennosis a reliable way to enhance the recall of deeply buried memories. We don't file away every single one of our experiences. We only permanently store some of them and even they tend to mutate over time. We'll be talking more about that in an upcoming lesson. Finally, only about 20% of us are thought to be highly hypnotizable. Those are the folks whom a pain, not by magically blocking pain receptors, but by helping us selectively not attend to that pain. Clinicians can do this by basically guiding the patient into a very relaxed but voluntary state sort of spaced out, and then further guiding them through a series of positive thoughts and suggestions.

Excluding other human minds, your mind is the most complicated piece of the universe that humans mental illness, and even treated patients in what was essentially a very early psych ward in his Baghdad hospital. From the efforts of those early thinkers up until today, the field of psychology has been all about tackling some of the big questions. How can humans do horrible things like commit genocide and torture other humans, and how come we know those things are horrible? Do we have free will, or are we build our views on childhood, personality, dreams, and sexuality, and his work fueled a legacy of both support and opposition. His life was long and spent an important swath of history from the American Civil War to World War II. But like most great scientists, Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by building on the sounding name, it really relied so much on introspection that it became too subjective. I mean, you may sense and feel something different than I do, even if we lick the same kitten.. Now, you probably think of psychoanalysis as a treatment, the whole patient on the couch scenario, and that's definitely partight. So what Freud was really saying was that mental disorders could be healed through talk therapy and self-discovery. And this was a really big breakthrough because prior to this, people with mental illnesses would be confined to sanatoriums and at best given menial labor to do, and at worst, shackled to a bed frame. After the interpretation of dreams, Freud went on to publish over 20 more books You may remember Skinner as the dude who put rats and pigeons and babies in boxes and conditioned them to perform certain behaviors. Right around when Freud escaped to England, Skinner published his behavior of organisms, ushering in the era of behaviorism, which remained all the rage well in the 1960s. The other major force at the time was, of course, Freud's psychoanalysis and its many descendants, but the essence of the discipline has everything to do with creating different ways of asking interesting questions and attempting to answer them through all kinds of data gathering methods. The human mind is complicated. There is no single way to effectively crack it open. It must be pride at from all sides. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingrich has gazed into the distant horizons of space, and even he has acknowledged that the human brain is by far the most complex physical object known to us\", 'Psychology'], [\" I can be smooth and charming and slick. I can make a very confident impression and it's hard to put me at a loss for words. Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about unlimited success and power and beauty. I have repeatedly used deceit to cheat con or defraud others for my personal gain. To be honest, I don't have much concern for the feelings of other people or their suffering. Doesn't sound like the that create noticeable problems in life. And as you can tell from these self-assessment statements, they can range from relatively harmless displays of narcissism to a true and troubling lack of empathy for other people. Not only could personality disorders be difficult to diagnose and understand, showing no interest in relationships and a few emotional responses. Cluster B encompasses dramatic, emotional, or impulsive personality characteristics. For example, a narcissistic personality can display a selfish grandiose sense of self-importance and entitlement. Meanwhile, a histrionic personality might seem like they're acting apart to get attention, even putting themselves at risk the condition can be messy and difficult. One proposed alternative for diagnosing these disorders is the dimensional model, which in essence gets rid of discrete disorders and replaces them with a range of personality traits or symptoms, rating each person on each dimension. So the dimensional model would assess a patient not with the aim of diagnosing one disorder or another, but instead, simply finding out that they rank high on, say, narcissism and avoidance. It's a work in progress, so with another generation, the good news is that some psychotherapies have helped even the most severely suffering repeatedly hospitalized BPD patients. But probably the most famous, well-established, and frankly troubling personality disorder is anti-social personality disorder. I've heard of this before, but maybe by one of it's now somewhat out of vogue synonyms, psychopathy or sociopathy. People with anti-social personality disorder, usually men, exhibit a lack of conscience for, and concern for friends and family. But still, although antisocial personalities make up just about 1% of the general population, they were estimated in one study to constitute about 16% of the incarcerated population. So how might someone end up with such a disturbing disorder? Well, as you might expect, the causes are probably a tangled combination of biological and psychological threads, both genetic and environmental. Although no one has found a single genetic predictor of antisocial personality disorder revealed that when shown evocative photographs like a child being hit or a woman with a knife at her throat, those with psychopathic personality features showed little change in heart rate and perspiration as compared to control groups. The classic antisocial lack of impulse control and other symptoms have also been linked to deficits in certain brain structures. One study compared PET scans from 41 people convicted of murder to those of be in trying to prevent it. According to American psychiatrist Donald W. Black, among others, many kids diagnosed with conduct disorder, the diagnostic precursor to antisocial disorder, are at high risk for developing antisocial personalities as adults. But by identifying warning signs early on and by working with these kids and families to correct their behavior and remove negative influences, some of that impulse fearlessness could be channeled into healthier direction.\", 'Psychology'], [\" So the name of it, Pavlov rings a bell. It's because his experiments are among the most famous in the history of psychology. His work contributed to the foundation of the behaviorist school of thought that viewed psychology as an empirically rigorous science focused on observable. Soon enough, he was turning out his famous series of experiments in which he paired the presence of meat powder, yummy, which got the dogs to drooling with lots of different neutral stimuli. Things that wouldn't break down for you the sequence of steps in Pavlov's famous experiment to help you get a sense of how conditioning works. First, before conditioning, the dog just drools when it smells food. That smell is the unconditioned stimulus and the slobbering, the unconditioned or natural response. The ringing that, but methodologically, classical conditioning shows how a process like learning can actually be studied through direct observation of behavior in real time without all those messy feelings and emotions. This is something Pavlov especially appreciated given, while Watson eventually left academia and got into advertising where he put all that associative learning to lucrative use. So that's classical well, and she loved her dad plenty. Skinner did, however, invent something called an air crib, a climate-controlled box with a window on the front that was meant to keep babies warm and safe while their moms ran around doing their 1950s lady thing. It's not strengthens responses by giving rewards after a desired event, like the rat snack after the lever push, or getting a cookie when you say please. Negative reinforcement is a little trickier. It's what increases a behavior by taking shelter, which are still the primary drivers. Plus, just as there are different kinds of reinforcers, so are there various reinforcement schedules. Like those boxed rats were getting continuous reinforcement when they got a treat every single time they hit the lever, so they picked it up pretty quickly. But if one day the rat child doesn our thoughts, perceptions, feelings, memories also influence the way we learn. We're going to talk about how these other things factor into learning next week.

You've definitely heard of them. But not everyone knows the story of their author, J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien was an English World War I veteran, a reluctant soldier he joined up with a sense of duty, and he lived through the bloody battle of some, suffering tremendous shock, guilt, and loss during and after the war. It took Tolkien years to process his experiences. To help him do it, he turned to writing fiction, and how do you treat them so that the patients can recover, with the understanding that they might never be the same as they were before the trauma, but they can still be healthy and happy? In a way, psychology helps patients ask themselves what Tolkien asks his readers, and what Frodo asks when he's finally safe back in the shire. How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you. The second involves avoiding situations you associate with the event while the third generally describes excessive physiological arousal, like heart pounding muscle tension, anxiety, or irritability, and major problems sleeping or concentrating. Finally, we have the fourth major symptom cluster, pervasive negative changes in emotions and belief, like feelings of PTSD through the lens of fear conditioning, or the unshakable memory of being in mortal danger, and the learned responses that stem from that memory. But clinicians have also begun to recognize that for some, the disorder can also be a kind of moral injury, widening the focus to include hauntings not just of violence done to a person, but also what that person did or did not vulnerable than others. We also know that context and environment matter. For instance, someone who has experienced childhood abuse might feel, on the one hand, more ready to deal with difficult and traumatic experiences. But on the other hand, there might be more likely to default to the suppression and avoidance in which PTSD sufferers frequently engage, which, as we've discussed in previous episodes, often That's in part what Tolkien did. Though he suffered great trauma and loss on the battlefield, he was eventually able to use those experiences to drive those powerful allegorical stories, stories that help not just himself, but many readers of all ages around the world. It seems that person deals with stress and difficult emotions, or what kind of stressful situations they've survived. Few will dispute that much can't treat the underlying problem without first getting the addiction out of the way. While this controversy, too, continues many are moving toward a model of treating both at the same time, the so-called dual-diagnosis model of treatment.

Slave owners and Nazis, any of the perpetrators of history's atrocities. How do they so successfully dehumanize other people for so long? At a smaller scale, how do bullies in the lunchroom manage to treat other kids with such cruelty and then go home and pet their dog and call their grandma and say, Happy Birthday? Most of what we've been studying so far has focused on the individual. We've covered subfields of the things we're really asking is, did they do what they did because of their personality or their situation? Austrian psychologist Fritz Heider began plumbing the depths of this question in the 1920, which would be appropriate for the situation, as a sexual come-on. We choose how we explain other people's behavior every day, and what we choose to believe can have big consequences. For example, our political views will likely be strongly influenced by whether we decide to attribute poverty or homelessness to personal dispositions, like being lazy and looking for a handout, or social circumstances, like more of a gut reaction. So you might decide to vote for a particular candidate because you think they're cute or because they're from your hometown. Peripheral route persuasion happens more readily when you're not paying a ton of attention, which is why billboards and television ads can be scarily effective. So that's how politicians and advertisers and maybe bosses and teachers and pushy friends try to change our behavior by changing our attitudes. But it turns out that the reverse is true too better example of this than the prisoners. A few prisoners only made it through the first night before they became too emotionally distressed and had to be released. Things only went downhill from there. Though the guards could act anyway they wanted, as long as they didn't believe in. Some people can and do resist turning to the dark side, even when it seems like everyone around them is going mad. And yet, the fact is, these people tend to be in the minority. So why? Why does it seem so easy to rationalize a negative action or attitude, and so hard to muster the positive ones? One partial explanation ordinarily peaceful guy he was before. It's kind of an inverted fundamental attribution error if you think about it, attributing a person's actions mainly to the situation instead of his personality. The point is that this mismatch between what we do and who we think we are induces tension, cognitive dissonance, and that we tend to want to resolve that tension. That's part of what turns an Anakin into a Darth Vader, and then, if we're lucky, back into an Anakin.

The Curious Case of Finneas Gage In 1848, a genial chap named Finneas Gage was working on the railroad, tamping gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron rod, when the gunpowder ignited. The resulting explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet up through his left from America, the scientific establishment lost contact with him, and 12 years later, after a series of seizures, he died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great, if extreme example of how function is localized in the brain, and how physical biological factors can be reflected in psychological ways. Of course, he's also an excellent example of how individual case studies are not particularly useful, especially since we have very little data on that nearly every region of the brain lights up during even simple tasks, like walking and talking. Not only that, but the brain itself requires 20% of all the body's energy, and it would make little evolutionary sense to throw much energy away at something that's only minimally active. As animals, our capabilities have pair of egg-shaped structures that take in sensory information related to seeing, hearing, touching, and tasting. The reticular formation is a finger-shaped nerve network inside the brainstem that's essential for arousal, which isn't necessarily what you feel upon seeing a particularly nice-looking human, but instead refers to things like sleeping and walking and pain perception, other important functions. The baseball-sized cerebellum, circadian rhythms, and hunger also helps govern the endocrine system, especially the pituitary gland.

The rest of your gray matter is made up of association areas that are related to higher mental functions like remembering, thinking, learning, and speaking. But the thing about association areas is that unlike your sensory or motor cortex, you couldn't just poke one and create any response. Association areas are more subtle.

At times, she goes through bouts of depression that make it hard for her to even get out of bed. Sometimes she suffers from serious anxiety around things like test taking, flying, lots of things, all of which are brutalizing her self-worth and affecting her performance in work and life. She's ready to get several related therapies in the psychodynamic family, and it was basically the first. In essence, Freud assumed that we didn't really know, or at least fully understand, ourselves or our motivations. So psychoanalysis served as a pilot or something to understand the roots of her fear. Today, traditional psychoanalysis is less common. Critics have pointed out that psychoanalytic interpretations aren't easy to prove or disprove, which is a problem when you're trying to take the scientific approach. Plus, psychoanalysis tends to involve many sessions, sometimes four or five a week, over a long period of time, and health insurance. Just won't cover that anymore. Therapists, who have branched off froml, Fritz Purls, and others, who emphasize people's inherent capacity for making rational choices, achieving self-acceptance and attaining their maximum potential.

In the's say Bernice sees an existentialist humanistic therapist and talks about her depression and how it's keeping her from living a full life.

In 1954, a group of 11 boys, all about 12 years old, were invited to a special summer camp in the deep woods of southeastern Oklahoma at a place called Robbers Cave State Park. None of the boys knew each other, although they all came from similar backgrounds. They spent their days bonding over things like games and swimming in treasure hunts, and in no time they formed a tight, friendly group. They even came up with a name for themselves, the Rettlers. Soon they began to notice conflicts. Specifically, Shireef wanted to test something called realistic conflict theory. He hypothesized that conflict happens when you combine negative prejudices with competition over resources, and the boys at Roberts' cave were well on their way to proving him right. Over the next couple of days, the Rattlers and the Eagles competed against each other. You might think of it as the psychology of war and peace, or the frontal lobes, which play a vital role in impulse control. And finally, our aggressiveness can be influenced by our own biochemistry. Hormones, like testosterone and glucocorticoids, and pheromones, have all been implicated in animal models of aggression. It's a little trickier in humans. It's a lot trickier in humans, but it's highly likely that our hormones are intimately linked with feeling and showing aggression. Obviously, aggression isn't just about biology. Psychological and cultural factors also us annoyed and angry, others breed friendship and affection. So yes, there are positive topics in social psychology, like altruism. Our selfless, even self-sacrificing regard for the welfare of others. This could be something as simple as jump-starting a stranger's car, or as heroic as running into a burning building to save someone. But if being altruistic is so awesome, why aren't we all that way all the time? Or maybe the better question is, why do we ever do anything selfless? Like, what's in it, referred to as the bystander effect, can weaken our instinct for altruism. The bystander effect is a bit like the concept of social loafing that we talked about. If you're around other people, it's easier to think that someone else is going to pick up the slack, or in this case, come to the rescue. When people do decide to help others, they may do it for a number of reasons. One perspective is that we tend to help others mainly out of self-interest. By this thinking, helping really isn't altruistic at altruism were the standard for human behavior, but then psychology wouldn't be nearly so interesting. In some ways, you might say that what fuels conflict is the opposite of altruism, self-interest. Social psychologists view conflict as any perceived incompatibility of actions, goals, or ideas. That could mean two nations fighting over a border, sparring religious or political groups, or you and your boo peace. The power of cooperation to make friends of former enemies is one of the most hopeful areas of psychological research.

Every science has certain concepts that are so fundamental yet abstract that we have a hard time finding the appropriate words to describe them.

Acetylcholine enables muscle action and influences learning and memory. Alzheimer's patients experience a deterioration of their acetylcholine-producing neurons. Dopamine, meanwhile, is associated with to other tissues, especially the brain. So while the nervous and endocrine systems are similar in that they both produce chemicals destined to hit up certain receptors, they operate at very different speeds.

They thought he looked suspicious. When they pulled over, he retreated into the doorway and began digging in his pocket. He kept digging as the police shattered at him to show his hands. A few seconds later, the man, Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant New Guinea, was dead, hit by 19 over or shot and killed for reaching for a wallet. In the last two episodes, we've examined how we think about and how we influence one another. But social psychology is also about how we relate to one another. Like what factors might cause us to help another person or harm them or fear them? What are the social and cognitive and emotional roots of prejudice, races of insects as a man? How do they shape our society? These are some of a general cognitive process that doesn't have to be negative. It can even be accurate at times. Like, I have the stereotype that all crows have wings, injuries and birth defects aside, and that happens to be true. But on the negative end, your prejudice against female mechanics may be rooted in some inaccurate stereotype about women's skills with a socket wrench. And when stereotypical beliefs combine with prejudicial attitudes and emotions, like fear and memory, and attitudes in that while we're aware of our explicit thoughts, our implicit cognition still operates under the radar, leading us clueless about its effect on our attitudes and behavior. In the same way, prejudice can be non-conscious and automatic. And I mean, it can be so non-conscious that even when people ask us point blank about our attitudes, we unwillingly or unknowingly don't always give them an honest answer. Then the test asks you to do the same thing in a counter-stereotypic condition, pressing the left key if you see a young face or an unpleasant object, and the right key if you see an old face or a pleasant object. The core of the test is your reaction time. Are you faster at sorting when you're working with a stereotypical pairing than you are with counter-stereotypical pairings? If that's the case, even though you may think, they viewed her as less competent, were less likely to hire her, offered her less money, and were less likely to mentor her. And this prejudice was even exhibited by women faculty members. And that's an important point. People on both sides of the.

We've talked about cognition before. We usually refer to it as the process that we use to think and solve crossword puzzles and stuff, but really, cognition involves knowing, remembering, understanding the time, and sometimes you just kinda look stupid. We all wanna make sense of the world, and one of the major ways our cognition allows us bird prototypes. Still, if I show you a picture of some crazy creature you've never seen before and you know that it has feathers into beak, you probably file it under the bird category because it more closely resembles your concept of bird than your concept of rodent or overcoat or footstool. Concepts and prototypes speed up our thinking, but they also can box our thinking in and lead to prejudice if we see something that solutions. Algorithms are logical, methodical, step-by-step procedures that guarantee an eventual solution, though they may be slow to work through. Heuristics, on the other hand, are more like mental shortcuts. Simple strategies that allow us to solve problems faster, although they're more error-prone than algorithms.

Those sudden bursts of insight aren't awesome to tell you, people can get really weird and defensive when they evade facts and choose to see only the information that confirms their beliefs.

You're wandering around Stanford University looking for a sandwich or something when you happen to walk by a particular room in a particular lab and see something... little unnerving. Namely, you find a woman punching an inflatable clown named Bobo in the neck. Over and over in its neck. This was the lab of legendary psychologist Albert Bandura to thank for that. His research hastened the evolution of 20th century experimental psychology from pure behaviorism into what we now know as social cognitive learning. While it was closely related to behaviorism, the social cognitive models added profoundly new dimensions to what Skinner and Watson and Pavlov had observed in our feathered and furry friends. In other words, it showed us that just as there is more thanlov Watson and Skinner had a problem with their assertions that when it came to learning, it didn't matter much whether you're training rats, pigeons, or people. It's all the same. Because lots of research has demonstrated that an animal's capacity for conditioning is actually limited by its biology. Consider this scenario. Say, I get a raging case of food poisoning after eating my headweight in raw oysters with my friend Bernice. I'm probably not going to want to touch oysters its wings to avoid the shock, because flying away from danger is what pigeons naturally do. Learned associations are even more complicated in humans, of course, because what we learn doesn't only influence our behavior a response with a consequence. There's thinking happening too. And this kind of thinking is also a big part of observational learning, which is started abusing Bobo, not just with little toddler punches, but with hostile language, and even using things like toy guns that they'd previously had no interest in. And all because they saw aggressive modeling in action. And since Bander is time, technology has allowed us to peer even deeper into this dynamic. Neuroimaging in humans, for instance, observational social learning starts really early, and parental figures are powerful role models. Positive, supportive, and loving models usually prompt similar behavior in others just as negative aggressive modeling can spark antisocial effects. And as we'll talk about later, what we see and feel and learn as children is not easily displaced when we're adults.

And what you see is, well, our perception, or how up, I look like some kind of terrifying monster.

Visually, we want to fill in gaps, to create whole objects. So here, we see an illusory triangle breaking the completion of these circles on the left, but just add the little lines close off the circles and you stop seeing the triangle. Horn perception is obviously crucial to making sense of the world or, you know, a moderately two fingers. Because those left and right images vary only slightly, retinal disparity doesn't help much when it comes to judging far-off distances. For that, we look to monocular cues to help us determine the scale and distance of an object. These are things like relative size and height, linear perspective, texture gradient, and interposition. Relative size allows you to determine that your crush is not supporting a tiny newborn jihuahua on their shoulder, but rather there's shrinking objects are retreating and enlarging objects are approaching, the thing is, your brain is easily tricked when it comes to motion. For instance, large objects appear to move much more slowly than small ones going the same speed.

Perceptual constancy is what allows us to continue to recognize an object regardless of its distance, viewing angle, motion,\", 'Psychology'], [\" HOMONGULUS!

From there, sound vibrations are amplified by the so-called ossicle bones, which also happen to be the most awesomely named bones in your body, the stirrup, the hammer, and the anvil.

Has she found a way to manage her depression? Is she still racked with anxiety? Well, it's really nice of you to ask, and I'll tell her you said hi. But for our purposes, as students of psychology, the bigger question arising from Bernice's case is, has psychotherapy helped? And just as important, how can we tell? Well, believe it or not, one of the main ways experts use is to simply ask the client and see how and doing it well. The methods psychologists use to assess how effective treatments are mostly involve client and clinician perceptions along with outcome research. Client perceptions are just what they sound like. You see a therapist and someone asks you how you feel after your treatment. It varies by treatment, but client perception tends to be pretty rosy. One study found that 89% of folks said that they were at least one experimental group that receives the treatment. This design accounts for individual differences between people and other extraneous factors so that we know that if people in the experimental group get better and people in the control group don't, it was truly the therapeutic intervention that made the difference. And once enough researchers have run their own RCTs, you can gather data via meta-analysis, measuring results across multiple trials to see basically whether a treatment works andCTs. And while a lot of psychologists seem to get a kick out of arguing about which therapies are better than others, there do seem to be some common factors that unite the more effective ones. A big one is simply instilling hope, helping demoralized clients regain hope that things can and will get better. There's also the value of getting a new perspective, learning that there's a plausible explanation for your troubles and finding a new way of looking at yourself, theotics are used to treat schizophrenia and other types of severe thought disorders. Most of these medications alter the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain by blocking its receptor sites and blocking its uptake. This is based on the assumption that an overactive dopamine system contributes to schizophrenia, but like many psychotropic drugs, antipsychotics come with nasty side effects. Angxiolytics or anti-an-analyses suggest that antidepressants aren't any more effective than psychotherapy when symptoms are mild to moderate. One meta-analysis that riled people up in recent years even suggested that antidepressants are no better than a placebo in those cases. So psychotropic drugs can seizure beneficially alters neurotransmitter activity in areas of the brain associated with moods and emotions, effectively jump- hypothesized to jumpstart the neural circuitry in a depressed brain similarly to ECT.

And worse, he hadn't told anyone where he was going. For the next five days, Ralston tried to help us understand what drives us. Let's start with the first theory, an evolutionary perspective. For a while, in the early 20th century, it was popular to motivation suggests that a psychological need or drive simply compels us to reduce that need. This is called the drive reduction theory. This could be as simple as hearing my stomach growl and looking for a burrito. My need is overstimulated and stressed.

Of course, everyone has a different level of optimal arousal, and I'm guessing Aaron higher level needs may vary depending on our culture and finances and personalities. But still, everyone is restricted by the lowest levels of the pyramid.

Soon she became obsessed with dieting, and it quickly spiraled into her subsisting only on rice cakes and apples and candy released eight months later. Though Lauren suffered a few relapses over the years, she is now healthy. Ultimately, she was lucky. Anorexia, bulimia, and other eating and body dysmorphic disorders can kill. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychological disorders, with some of the highest eventually, an abnormally low body weight.

Our old friend, the DSM-5, actually delineates two schizophrenia, tend to be the result of secondary behavior, like suicide. But with anorexia, the mortality rate is especially high because people can die as a direct result of extreme weight loss and physiological damage. Another common eating disorder is bulimia nervosa. While anorexia is characterized primarily by the refusal to maintain a minimal body weight, bulimia is not. People with bulimtale sign of childhood sexual abuse, as was once commonly thought. Instead, these disorders are often predictive indicators of a person's feelings of low self-worth, need to be perfect, falling short of expectations, and concern with others' perceptions. Although the prevalence of bulimia and binge eating is similar among ethnic groups in the United States, anorexia is much more common among white women, often of higher socioeconomic status. But the prevalence of these disorders is rising psychological illness, one that centers on a person's obsession with physical flaws, either minor or just imagined. Though suffering from this disorder often obsess over their appearance, often staring into mirrors for hours and feel distressed or ashamed by what they see. Although it's often lumped in with the eating disorders, our growing understanding of body dysmorphiaically, there are a few compelling clues. In the case of eating disorders, for example, research has long suggested that neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine may play a role. Dopamine is involved in regions of the brain, connected to hunger and eating, like the hypothalamus and nucleosacumbins. And some research has found that binge eating appears to alter the regulation of dopamine production in a way that can reinforce further binging.

It's called attachment, and if you've ever seen a clingy kid, you know why it's called that. They'd attach.

And sometimes they fed from the wire mother with the baby bottle while standing on the cloth one. This discovery that attachment wasn't just about getting breakfast, surprised a lot of people.

Most of the macaques used in the study never recovered, and those who were forced into pregnancy didn't know how to care for their own offspring.

If the kid freaked out, the stranger would try to comfort them. Then mom would come back, and the stranger would leave. Different children responded differently interest upon her return. Ainsworth observed that sensitive, attentive mothers usually raised securely attached kids, whereas less responsive mothers who often ignored their children, or super anxious mothers who obsessed over every little thing, often raised insecurely attached toddlers. And then, of course, on the extreme, forming positive attachments, then one of the biggest achievements in childhood would have to be achieving a positive sense of self. This self-concept or an understanding and evaluation of who we are is usually pretty solid by about the time we turn reasons for their rules and are loving and responsive.

They might help an educator identify a simply validity, where the extent to which a test measures or predicts what it's supposed to. And there are different kinds of validity.

Because we're gonna be testing your memory how? How does all of that data that we're exposed to all the time every day become memory? In the late 1960s, American psychologists Richard Atkinson and Richard Schifrin figured out enough about the process of memory formation to break it down into three stages. First, it's encoded as it is, can really only hold between four and seven distinct bits of information at a time. At which point, the memory either decays, or it gets transferred into long-term memory. Long-term memory is your brain's like durable and ridiculously spacious storage unit, holding all of your knowledge, skills, and experiences. Now, since the days of Atkinson our working memory often transfers stuff we're not aware of to long-term storage. We call that an implicit process, the kind you don't have to actively concentrate on. A good example might be classically conditioned associations, like if you get all sweaty and nervous at the dentist because he had a root canal last year. You don't need to pull up that file on the last time you got your face drilled on to think, well, oral surgery, seem to be deeply affected, his procedural memories for things seem to be in one piece. This has to do with neuroanatomy that we do not have time to explore here, and that we don't yet fully understand. Waring and others have a lot to teach us about the different types of long-term memory storage. Now, for healthy memories, there are lots of little tricks you can use to help remember information. Mnemonics, for one, help with memorization, and I'm sure you case, you might remember the story of that megatuff, yet very scantily clad warrior of ancient Greece. Or you might remember that Leon means lion in Greek, and that lions are tough fighters in that Leonidas was a tough Spartan warrior king. And then to really, really, megat stick, you want to connect it to something meaningful or related to your own personal emotional experience.

The famous physician, professor, and author of unusual neurological case studies will be looking at some of his fascinating research and future lessons, but for now, I just want to talk about Sacks himself. Although he possesses a brilliant and inquisitive mind, Dr. Sacks cannot do a simple thing that your average toddler can. He can't recognize his own face in the mirror. Sacks perception, which is pretty meta. Now, your brain is interpreting that light as moment. This has to do with signal detection theory, a model for predicting how and when a person will detect a weak stimuli partly based on context. Exhausted new parents might hear their baby's tiniest whimper tiny bit brighter than another tiny star, I can tell. But if a big star is that same tiny amount brighter than another big star, I won't be able to tell the difference. This is important enough that we gave the guy who discovered it a law. Weber's law says that we perceive differences on a logarithmic, not linear scale. It's as reddish-use. The way we register the brightness of a color, the contrast between the orange of a sure-burt and the orange of a construction cone, has to do with the intensity or amount of energy in a given light wave, which, as we just said, is determined by its amplitude. Greater amplitude means higher intensity means brighter color. Our cones detect fine detail and color. Concentrated near the retina's central focal point, called bifovia, cones function only in well-lit conditions, allowing you to appreciate the intricacies of your grandma's china pattern or your uncle's sleeve tattoo. And the human eye is terrific at seeing color. Our different threshold for colors is turn, activate the cells behind them, called bipolar cells, whose job it is to turn on the neighboring ganglion cells. The long axon tails of these ganglions braid together to form the ropey optic nerve, which is what carries the neural impulses from the eyeball to the brain. That visual information then slips through a chain of progressively complex levels as cloud is frowning and running at me with a tiny cream pie. I'm putting these factors together. Maybe I should get out of here. This ability to process and analyze many separate aspects of the situation at once is called parallel processing. In the case of visual processing, this means that the brain simultaneously works on making sense of form, depth, motion, and color. And this is where we enter the whole world of perception, which gets complicated quickly and can even get downright philosophic.\", 'Psychology'], [\" So far, in our exploration of how the mind grows, we've talked about a lot of different philosophies and models and ways of looking at things. But here's a surprisingly useful tool for understanding developmental psychology, the Breakfast Club. This video, by the way, will contain Breakfast Club spoilers. That classic 80s movie about a band of teenagers stuck in detention one fateful expectations of what roles they should play, hence the confusion. In the past couple weeks, we've been talking about childhood as a crucial period of growth, learning, and change, and it definitely is. But anyone who's ever seen a John Hughes early childhood development, I'm going to skip ahead to the teenage meat of it, but you can consult this table to learn about the rest. Erickson defined the adolescent years, or Stage 5. As starting in our teens and extending for some as far number of psychologists have begun to refer to the first few years of this stage as emerging adulthood, and some suggest that it warrants its own classification distinct from adolescence or full adulthood. And at least in modern western culture, many people in this stage do feel like they're stuck in a sort of in-between time. They know that they've pulled developed a sense of integrity and completeness, meaning they're pretty satisfied with a life well lived. The flip side of that is looking back on life and feeling guilt and regret, and that kind of retrospective disappointment can ruin old age with depression and feelings of hopelessness. Again, Erickson's model isn't really a perfect contemporary one, butold on 100-meter dash because, of course, how well do you take care of your body counts for a lot, but still, you can't stop, let alone reverse the process of aging. The good news is our intelligence remains pretty stable throughout adulthood. Although some people might feel that their wits get a bit fuzzy with age, research suggests that while one kind of intelligence decreases after adolescence, another kind keeps increasing throughout your lifetime. Psychologist Raymond Cattell and John Horan were the first to get the job of thinking done. So in the end, some of our thinking gets rusty with age, but some of it keeps getting better. Of course, there are exceptions. While most people who live into their 90s are still pretty sharp, some will experience a substantial loss of brain cells and suffer serious consequences. Brain tumors, small strokes, or continued alcohol dependence can all progressively damage the brain, increasing the risk of dementia. Dement be ready for a reunion. And they'd better make a movie about it. Today, you're developing brain, learned about Erickson's eight stages of progressive psychosocial development and their accompanying issues.

Much of our technology relies on substances that can conduct electricity, meaning that they allow the flow of an electrical current. But what is it about a material that allows it to do this stretching endlessly in every direction. We know that when two atomic orbitals combine, two molecular orbitals will be generated, one lower energy bonding orbital and one higher energy anti-bonding orbital. Thus, as more and more covalent bonds form, more molecular orbitals remain vacant. Second, in a conductor, the difference in energy between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is infinitesimally small, which means that electrons can move freely between orbitals, and this is the key feature of a conductor that allowsonductors conduct electricity better at higher temperatures, because there is more thermal energy available to promote electrons into the conduction band, and thus a stronger current is able to form. So what kinds of materials can act as semiconductors the dopant has fewer electrons, the valence band will end up not completely full, and current will again be able to flow. This is called a p-type semiconductor, where p stands for positive. Electronic components like diodes and transistors utilize both p and n-type semiconductors, so these techniques are very important\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's learn the laws of thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics help us understand why energy flows in certain directions and in certain ways. A lot of the concepts described by thermodynamics seem like common sense, but there is a layer of math universe is always increasing. Within a system, there is also a tendency to go towards higher entropy. The classic analogy is that your bedroom will over time become messy, but it won't suddenly become neat. Another way to look at this is to say that entropy is a measure of how dispersed the energy of the system is amongst theically favorable. We can look at all kinds of processes to highlight entropic influence. Heat will flow from a hot coffee cut into the table or your hand because the heat energy will be more disordered if more dispersed. This is why heat spontaneously flows from hot to cold and not the other way around. If positive, it is non-spontaneous. So we can use this equation to see how a spontaneous process can be either enthalpically or entropically favorable, or both, but not neither. For example, if delta H is negative, which means exothermic and energetically favorable, the entropic unfavorability will be minimized at lower temperatures. This is a very important equation to understand, because it describes all of the spontaneous processes in the universe. There are those who incorrectly use entropy and the second law of thermodynamicssoluble due to the polar heads facing out. That's how soap works. And that's also how highly ordered structures can form spontaneously if by enthalpically favorable or energy storing processes. In this way, systems can defy entropy on the small scale. But the second law does hold true in that the entropy of the universe\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey, it's Professor Dave. Let's talk about acids and bases. We've probably all heard the terms acid and base, but what do these words mean on the molecular level? Let's discuss the rigid definition according to a few different models. Most often, when we talk about acids and bases acidity and basicity. This is what the Lewis definition entails. Under the Lewis definition, a base is something that donates a pair of electrons. And an acid is something that accepts moment. As temperature increases, Kw increases. Hydronium concentration, which is essentially proton concentration, if above 1 times 10 to stable the conjugate base will be. Comparing the acids made by combining a hydrogen with a halogen, we can see that HI is the strongest. This is because when the proton leaves, we are left with an iodide ion. This is much larger than a fluoride ion, and therefore can diffuse the negative structures don't actually exist, but rather the composite resonance structure does, which shows delocalized pi-electron density distributed about this portion of the molecule. More on this in organic chemistry. There can be monoprotic acids, which can only lose one proton, or polyprotic acids, which can be cumbersome to list. So we have developed a more convenient way to describe acidity. The pH of a solution is the negative log of the hydronium concentration. Logarithms are the inverse operations of exponents, so the reason why a negative log is useful here is that it takes an annoying number like 10 to the negative 7, and it turns it into 7. using this chart.

But what are the applications of the solubility product? For one thing, we can use a KSP to look at a solution and predict if a solid precipitate will form as a result of a chemical reaction. is the way to predict whether precipitation will occur in solution. For example, to prepare magnesium metal, we allow magnesium hydroxide to precipitate from seaw other ion will need to reach in order for precipitation to begin to happen. We application of this is that water with a manganese ion concentration above 1.8 times 10 to the negative 6 moles per liter will stain clothing get the pH, which will be 10.2. Therefore, if there is enough base in the detergent to keep the pH above 10.2, the manganese ion concentration will remain below a threshold that would stain the close.

Le Chatelier's principle says that if you induce a stress on a system at equilibrium, the equilibrium will shift so as to relieve that stress. So let's see some examples of a stress we could put on a system at equilibrium. First, we could modify the reaction is exothermic and releases energy. So we could think of heat energy as a product of this reaction. If instead it's positive, that means it's endothermic, and energy must be absorbed for the reaction to go. So we could think of heat left means atoms fusing together, resulting in fewer particles which lowers the pressure on the container. If we increase the volume, thereby lowering the pressure, the equilibrium would shift towards the side with more particles in order to regain some of the lost pressure.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's talk about the Bohr model of the atom.

Another transition has a different energy gap associated with it and therefore generates a photon of that particular energy.

We know that atoms have a tiny nucleus with positively charged protons and neutrons which have no charge, as well as negatively charged electrons in the nucleus. This is kind of redundant because the type of element implies the number of protons, but sometimes we do it anyway. To the upper left is the mass number. This is not redundant because atoms of a given element can have different masses, all the way to 100 and more. Then we can look at the atomic masses. But if the atomic mass is the sum of the particles in the nucleus, shouldn't they all be whole numbers? There aren't any fractions of a neutron, after all.

There are many ionic substances, and we should be able to name them. But first, we must understand that ions come together to form compounds in ratios dictated by their charges. Positively charged ions, or c of each will do nicely. If we use magnesium instead of sodium, magnesium is 2 plus, so each magnesium ion will need two chloride ions to make a neutral compound. If we have magnesium and nitrogen, we will need three of the 2 plus and two of the 3 minus to get plus and minus 6. You just need the lowest common multiple for the two charges and use as many ions of each as you need to get there. ion. If there are more still, we can use the prefixes per and hypo in addition to the suffixes. So this is chlorate, this is chlorite, this is hypochlorite, but it is not implied in the written name. That's why we specify with the Roman numeral. If we are looking not at ions but at binary covalent compounds, which contain only two elements, we use a different set of prefixes to say how many atoms of each element there are. We can have carbon monoxide, or\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's talk solubility. When we first discussed solubility, we learned that some ionic compounds are water-soluble and will completely disperse in solution due to the ion-dipole interactions they will make with water molecules. We also learned that other ionic compounds are excess of it in water, it will dissolve to a tiny extent and cause a dynamic equilibrium. Some ions dissolve as other ions rejoin the lattice. Just as with any other type of equilibrium, there must be an equilibrium constant to describe it, and that's the solubility product. As we might guess, this will simply be equal to the product of these two ion concentrations. If we have something like magnesium hydroxide, it's the same thing except that dissociation produces one magnesium ion and two hydroxide ions, which means that hydroxide ion concentration will be squared in the solubility product for magnesium hydroxide? First, let's write the KSP expression for this substance, which we derived earlier. Notice that hydroxide concentration is squared due to the coefficient in the equilibrium. Now, if this is the concentration of the magnesium ion, then expression and use this to construct a simple ice chart. In this, we will not list any values for copper bromide as this is a solid. The ions themselves will start at zero. The change will be x because of the one to one to one ratio, and this means that the equilibrium concentrations of the ions will be zero, but the change will be x and 2x respectively due to the stoichiometry of the equation, and the equilibrium concentrations will also be x and 2x.

This makes it possible to take pretty reasonable data about the temperature change in a cup of water when we add a hot piece of metal. We can measure the temperature change in the water and use that information to calculate the specific heat of the metal. So we can take that same quantity of heat and plug it into a new equation for the metal. That value goes there.

Let's look at this more quantitatively. Cadmium sulfide has a KSP expression, like so. Now, since the KSP is so incredibly tiny when compared with the initial cadmium ion concentration, we can consider X, or the additional concentration of cadmium that will come from cadmium sulfide to be negligible.

And we find that it takes 11.6 milliliters of acid to reach the equivalence point.

The reactants create the products, which then go right back and create reactants. This means there is both a forward and a reverse reaction. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are the same, we measure that there are 0.135 moles of PCL3. So how much of the other two things are there? To answer this, we can make something called an ice box. These letters stand for initial, change, and equilibrium. We set them up like this. For initial, we put the initial amounts of each thing. We started with135 moles, which here will correspond to X, and we therefore know all the other concentrations by plugging in X. Simple, no. Well, it can get trickier as we will see. But first, let's learn about equilibrium expressions. Every equilibrium has an want to predict which way a mixture will go given some non-equilibrium quantities. To do this, we plug the non-equilibrium values into the KC expression to calculate the reaction quotient Q. If KC is bigger than Q, Q is more on the reactant side, so it'll make more products expression and solve for x. Luckily on the right, both the numerator and denominator are squared, so we can take the square root of both sides. If it wasn't this convenient, we may have had to use the quadratic equation.

We've learned a lot about ideal gases and some of the laws that describe their behavior. But up until now, we have been examining the relationships between the variables that pertain to the container. So the pressure from all the particles of one gas, plus the pressure from all the particles of another gas, should add up to be the total pressure for all the particles, assuming we are treating these collisions that is represented by any individual substance. To see this demonstrated, let's say we capture a sample of Earth's atmosphere at sea level. We know that there will be several different gases in the sample, as the atmosphere is comprised of nitrogen, Well, again, the partial pressure of a gas is related to the mole fraction of the gas, or the fraction of the mixture that gas represents by number of particles. This means we can take these percentages and divide them by 100 in order to express them as mole fractions.

In the reaction where hydrogen gas and oxygen gas go to make water, we can see that the gases have two atoms each and water has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. We will need to combine these substances in this ratio to make this equation balanced. Now there is balanced, eight on each side. Last is oxygen. On the right, there's six from CO2 and four from water for a total of 10. That means we will need five molecules of O2 to get 10 oxygen atoms on the left side. Now the equation is balanced. There is the same number of each type of atom on both sides, showing us the correct ratio in which these molecules will have to react.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's talk about non-ideal gases. We've learned all about ideal gases and the laws that govern them, as well as kinetic molecular theory, which explains why these laws are valid. But we must always recall that when operating in this framework, we are making several assumptions that are not totally accurate. An ideal gas must be very sparse, or have a very large volume in comparison to the volume occupied by the gas particles. If this is the case, we can indeed ignore the volume of the particles and treat them as points. But if a gas is compressed, until the particles are very close to one another, occupying a reasonable fraction of the total volume gas behavior. Although it is more difficult to describe non-ideal gas behavior in a quantitative way, we can still do so by using the Vander Waals equation. This equation is set up just like the ideal gas law, PV equals NRT, but it includes two correction factors. First, we adjust the pressure term with a correction factor associated with the attraction between the equation will remain unchanged. Each gas will have its own values for the constants A and B, and we will simply look them up in order to do calculations. Let's make sure to note that the van der Waals equation will reduce to the ideal gas law under ideal gas conditions. If the volume is very large and the number of moles is very small,ier, but still not too bad. First, let's rearrange the equation to solve for pressure by first dividing both sides by v minus nb and then subtracting the n squared a over v squared term. We will also need to know the values for the constants a less accurate in predicting things about this system. And now we have a firm, quantitative understanding of the differences between the ideal gas law and the Vander Waals equation, and the different kinds of conditions in which we might want to use one over another.

There's really no simpler repeating unit in three dimensions. So that's what this is going to look like. And so even take a look at this without those bonds if we want to see this a little more clearly. So here we can see that this is a quite a simple structure, right? This is about as simple as ionic compounds can get. And of course, this depends greatly on the relative sizes of the ions here. The sizes of the ions are quite similar. But this changes a little bit when the sizes of the ions become quite disparate. So let's the sizes of the ions. So the larger chloride ions are going to form that lattice and then the zinc ions are going to just fill in the gaps. They're going to fill in those tetrahedral holes. And so this case they will only fill half of the tetrahedral holes. So let's go ahead and build this out just a little bit. And we can get a better sense of this. And so this a rhombahedral structure. So they're not all cubic and there's actually many, many of these. So we won't go through all of them, but I wanted to show you one weird one. And so this is called rhombahedral. We saw what would have been a body centered cubic cell. We saw face centered as well. So that's another cool feature of ChemDoodle 3D. It's not just for covalent compounds. We can look at ionic compounds too. You can download any CIF file and just drag and drop right onto the screen here.

Metallic bonds are quite different from ionic or covalent bonds. One major difference stems from their extreme strength, which is what gives most metals such high melting and boiling points. Each atom within a metal is undergoing atomic orbital overlap with many neighboring atoms, and this generates an enormous number of of attraction between the nuclei and the electrons. This is where electron configuration becomes relevant. For example, sodium has one valence electron and therefore tends to form a one plus cation, while magnesium has two valence electrons and therefore tends to form a two plus cation. Coulomb's law dictates that a charge of a greater magnitude results in a stronger attraction, hammering, pressing, rolling, and other such methods. So we are essentially describing the metals ability to withstand pressure without breaking. Some metals are extremely malleable, which is why they have been so useful in building tools and weapons throughout human history. Aluminum and copper are examples of malle when it comes to material science, engineering, computer science, and other fields that are leading us into the future.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's talk about phase changes. It's possible for matter to transform directly between any of the three phases. We are probably aware of melting and freezing, which go between solids and liquids, as well as boiling and condensing, which go between liquid and gas. In addition, going directlyine solid. The melting point is the temperature at which a crystalline solid melts. These are the same temperature. They just represent processes in opposite directions. As we heat a sample of ice, it will melt and then makes intermolecular contacts of differing strength in the liquid phase.

When we react to substances, it's essentially impossible to have them present in precisely the correct amounts for both of them to react completely.

In reality, this does not occur, and the actual yield will always be some fraction of the theoretical yield, which we call the percent yield.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's learn about reaction mechanisms. We've learned a lot about chemical reactions, but what is necessary for a reaction to occur on the molecular level? Collision theory states that molecules involved in a reaction, whether in the liquid or gas phase, have to collide in a particular orientation and energy diagrams, we can also see delta H, or the difference in energy between the reactants and products. If the products sit lower, it is an exothermic reaction which releases energy. If the products sit higher, it is an endothermic reaction and needs to absorb energy to occur. Most people would refer to will have sufficient energy to surpass the activation barrier. So the overall reaction for many trillions of molecules will proceed more quickly. The Arrhenius equation shows how the rate constant depends on the activation rate law for the overall equation can be discerned directly from the rate determining step. And by this method, the exponents will equal the stoichiometric coefficients. Let's check comprehension.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's learn how to draw Lewis Dot Structures. We've learned about how ions come together to form ionic compounds, but much more interesting is the way atoms form networks of covalent bonds. In order to talk about this, we're going to have to learn how to draw Lewis Dot Struct bond, which always contains two electrons. For our purposes here, we can assume that electrons need to be paired, so a good Lewis dot structure will have all the electrons either inside covalent bonds or in lone pairs. The number of valence electrons an atom has dictates how many bonds it tends a formal charge. This happens if the number of electrons an atom is contributing to a Lewis Dot structure is different from its typical valence. Nitrogen has five valence electrons, so in ammonia, where it contributes those five, one per covalent bond plus the lone pair, it will be a neutral nitrogen atom.

Over the centuries, we've come a long way in terms of understanding the composition of the things around us. Far beyond categorizing matter as earth, water, air, or fire, we now understand matter on the atomic and subatomic level. When it comes to the air around us, our ancestorsatomic molecule which is relatively inert. It enters and exits our lungs when we breathe, but generally doesn't really do anything. Then the next most abundant component is oxygen. That makes up about 21% of the atmosphere. And that's the stuff we actually breathe. in the air, but rather make their way into the air, often as the result of some kind of human activity. Sometimes this is not a big deal at all, and other times it can be a significant health risk, so let's talk about some common air contaminants. When bacteria and viruses, mold spores, dust mites, allergens like pollen, and lots more. And of course, there is also your run-of-the-mill dust, which is just dirt tracked in from outside, mixed with soot, hair, and carpet fluff. Depending on the concentration and the duration of exposure, it is relatively simple to trap large particles on a filter, while all the tiny molecules move through the many tiny pores. High efficiency particulate arrestants filters can remove for home use. An example of such a product is the EnviroClan's air purification system.

The fast-paced technological innovation of the 21st century is no less impressive, as the technology previously found in expensive industrial products tend to get implemented in affordable consumer products within a decade.

As we begin to learn more about molecules, it's important to understand the way molecules are arranged in three-dimensional space, because this will affect how the molecule does chemistry. A model we can use to analyze molecular geometry is called the Vesper model, which stands for valence, shell, electron pair, repals. For now, we can just count the number of electron domains and use that many atomic orbitals to describe the hybridization of the central atom in a molecule. For each energy level, there is 1s, 3p's, and 5d's. So here, we just need 1s and 1p for these two electron domains. Anything that is sp hybridized is going to show linear electron domain geometry. These 109.5 degree bond angles put the hydrogens as far away from each other as they can be, making a shape that would have four sides if we connected the points. Atoms with five electron domains are SP3D hybridized and have trigonal bipyramidal electron domain geometry, basically two pyramids connected at the base. These complexes have both 90 and 120idal molecular geometry. The oxygen atom in a water molecule is also SP3 hybridized because it makes two bonds and has two lone pairs for a total of four electron domains. But the two lone pairs mean this molecule has a bent molecular geometry. It is very important to understand correct Lewis Dot structure, and then just count up the electron domains.

Silver chloride can begin to precipitate when the silver ion\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey, it's Professor Dave. Let's talk about electrolytes. Anyone who is a fan of sports beverages has heard of the word electrolyte before. But what does this word really mean? This term refers to a substance that when not dissociate at all will be a non-electrolyte. We can categorize substances as being one of these three things by measuring the electrical conductance of their corresponding aqueous solution to give individual cations and anions. The dissolution occurs because the cations and anions will be able to make ion dipole interactions with allow their interionic attractions to dissipate in favor of salvation. These covalent species undergo an actual chemical reaction with the solvent molecules in solution to form charged products. These will typically be strong acids and bases that either donate a proton. So, if hydrochloric acid were to be placed in an a-protic solvent like ether or hexanes, this would not result in an electrolytic solution, as these solvents can't accept any protons the way a water molecule can. But for aqueous solutions, let's keep in mind that strong acids and bases will be strong electrolytes because they iontes, or non-electrolytes.

We know that redox reactions are reactions in which electron transfer occurs. One substance is oxidized, which means itous solution, the dichromate ion will react with iron 2+, to yield chromium 3+, and iron 3+. How do we balance this? The first step is electrical charge for each half reaction by adding electrons. In the oxidation, in order for iron 2 plus to become iron 3 plus, it must lose an electron. So there must be one electron as a product here. For the algorithm will be just a little bit different. But it will start out by balancing as though we are under acidic conditions. So let's do that first, just as we have learned. Let's say we have some solid silver reacting with zinc 2 plus to become silver oxide and solid solution. First, we note how many protons there are, and we add that number of hydroxides to both sides, so that's two hydroxides on each side.

And as a result, we can no longer think of an atom as electrons revolving around a nucleus the way planets revolve around a star. We have to think of an electron as a cloud of probability density that represents regions where the electron can be found. Werner Heisenberg soon showed that as a result of quantum mechanics, there. We have to accept that this is a deeper tier of reality than what we can immediately perceive and comprehend.

We want to be able to calculate the concentration of various ions in solution when an formula unit that dissociates. In this case, it's very simple. Each formula unit of sodium chloride generates one sodium ion and one chloride ion. So 0.171 moles of the salt, once dissociated, will produce 0.171 moles of salt will yield 0.315 moles of calcium ions, but 0.630 moles of chloride ions, since there will be twice as many chloride ions as calcium ions after dissociation.

React with tells us that iron and fluorine are the reactants, and produce tells us that iron 3 fluoride is the product. So those should be separated by an arrow. Now let's translate the words into chemical symbols and phase symbols. The symbol for iron is Fe, and it make a neutral molecule. So we write F-E-F-3 with the subscript S. Lastly, we might want to balance the equation. We can see that we have two fluorines on the left and three on the right. So let's put a three here and a two there, so that we have six on each side.

Now that we understand that electrons are both particles and waves, we are ready to learn about how electrons are arranged in an atom. The location and energy of every electron in an atom is determined by a set of four quantum numbers that describe different atomic orbitals. An orbital is a region of probability where an electron can be found. There are 0, 1, or 2, because 2 is 3 minus 1. The L value describes the shape of the orbital. When L equals 0, we are describing S orbitals, which are spherical, just one of these per energy level. When L equals 1, we are describing P orbitals, which are lobes that extend outwards on three axes. There are three of these per energy level. When L will be either one half or negative one half, no matter what. So every electron in an atom has a unique set of quantum numbers. No two electrons in an atom can have precisely the same four quantum numbers, as is stated by the Pauli exclusion principle. This is because any orbital can only hold up to two electrons, and even the, giving us the 3s orbital. L could be 1, giving us the 3p orbitals, or L could be 2, giving us the 3d orbitals. A large atom will have to use all of these orbitals and orbital. If you want a quicker way to determine electron configurations, just know which areas of the periodic table correspond to which row it is in. We can use orbital diagrams to visually depict how the orbitals are filled, and they look like this. Don't forget Hun's rule, fill each set halfway before doubling up.

We have learned about different laws that can be applied to ideal gases. Like any laws, these ideal gas laws are merely summaries of observations, such as the way pressure and volume are inversely proportional particle or the walls of whatever container they are in, at which point they will bounce off and change direction. This vision of gas particles as moving around like billiard balls on a pool table seems pretty intuitive, but it is an important one as it implies that tiny particles like atoms are subjecting some of their kinetic energy of motion onto the walls of the container every time they collide with it. Just like a macroscopic object would transfer energy onto some surface during a collision. It may seem like atoms are so tiny that they can't impart much force. And that's true energy. They will simply bounce off of one another once again like balls on a pool table. And number five, the average kinetic energy of the particles in the gas is proportional to the temperature of the gas in Kelvin.'s law, if we increase the temperature, in order to keep pressure constant, meaning the frequency of collisions stays the same, the volume must expand. Because if the particles move faster, but also move farther, they will hit the sides with the same frequency of collisions.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey, it's Professor Dave, let's talk about solubility. We now know what a solution is, so we want to know how to determine whether two substances will be miscible or immiscible. That is, whether they will or won't mix to form a homogeneous solution. We must also understand that there is a limit to how many solute particles can fit in a solution of one that contains more solute than a saturated solution. This can happen when a solution is prepared at a very high temperature where solubility is heightened and then allowed to slowly cool. This is a very unstable one is greater will determine whether the substance dissolves or not. So here is sodium chloride as a solid, and here we have dissociated ions making ion-dipole interactions. How do we calculate these energies? It can be tricky to do experimentally, so we actually the lattice energy. Just look at tabulated data like this, and if the hydration energy of a substance is greater than the lattice energy, it should dissolve, as it will be energetically favorable for it to do so.

This also shows why covalent bond formation is always an exothermic process, because there will always be a decrease covalent bond, there is some kind of orbital overlap, and the pair of electrons will inhabit the overlapping region. It is the mutual attraction between both electrons and both atomic nuclei that facilitates this link. And the more significantly these orbitals overlap, the stronger the covalent bond,\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, let's check the pressure. We used to think that air was just empty space, but in the modern age, we know that air contains matter. Specifically, molecules of nitrogen, oxygen, and many others. These molecules participate in collisions, where they transfer some of their kinetic energy onto whatever they collide with. liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid when particles from the atmosphere collide with particles in the liquid. This activity keeps the liquid in the tube at a particular height, so by observing the height of the column of liquid in the tube, we can see how much the atmosphere is pushing down on the liquid. the fluid times G, the acceleration due to gravity. In order to support a column of fluid of a particular height, the atmospheric pressure will have to equal the hydrostatic pressure. We can see that gas that is trapped in a container. This is called a monometer. In a monometer, there will be a bulb containing some gas. This connects to a U-shaped tube that will contain some non-volatile liquid like mercury and the gas particles in the bulb more force. Or the atmosphere may be pushing with more force. Let's say we are looking at a closed-end manometer filled with mercury, and we measure the difference in height as being 26.4 centimeters. We can use this value to express the pressure of the gas that is pushing down on the mercury in a few different units. If we want to use Tor, we can just take our value in height of the two arms must be added to atmospheric pressure to get the pressure of the gas. We know atmospheric pressure is 760 millimeters of mercury, so we will take the 137 measured here and add it to 760 to get 897 millimeters mercury.

It's just to make the image pop. But there is one exception bonds, both of the electrons in the bond come from a Lewis base and are being donated to a metal center, like the lone pairs on each of these water molecules, which interact with the central metal ion to form this octahedral complex. If we want to show the coordination sphere, or the metal ion plus its ligands, using our with the metal atom occurs in many places. These can sometimes be called chelating ligands. Hemoglobin is such a ligand, because all four nitrogen atoms in the heme are coordinated to the iron atom. So technically this is a tetradentate ligand. Coordination compounds are fascinating structures that display a wide variety interesting geometries, like pentagonal bipyramid, square anti-prism, and dodecahedral. Many of these do not follow the geometries expected from the Vesper model due to details regarding non-bonding D electrons.

Second, we will always name the ligands first, and we will do so in alphabetical order. Once these have all are modified if the ligand itself begins with one of those prefixes, or a vowel, so as to remove ambiguity, resulting in the prefixes, bis, tris, and so forth. Now to put things together, when the complex as a whole is a cation, we will list the metal by the name of its element, so that's a total of plus 2, meaning the complex itself has a minus 2 charge as a whole.

So we know about atomic orbitals, and we learned that an atom can take its atomic orbitals and hybridize them into molecular orbitals. These hybridized orbitals have shapes that resemble combinations of the atomic orbitals, and these are. But if one electron were to become excited, it could jump from the sigma or bonding orbital to the sigma star or anti-bonding orbital. This is where hybridization comes into play. If an atom is participating in multiple bonds, it will utilize hybrid orbitals to form them.. An sp3 hybridized carbon is typically participating in four sigma bonds, but carbon can also be sp2 or sp hybridized. Let's look at an sp2 carbon. If it is sp2 hybridized, it has just three electron domains, which can happen if it has a double bond to something. Take c2h4, for example. Each of these carb to get the sp hybridized orbitals. That leaves two unhybridized p orbitals, each with one electron. In this case, they will generate two pi bonds, one from the overlap of these p orbitals, which are both full, that go to make the 1S sigma and 1S sigma star, which are also both full. Then the 2S orbitals, also both full, which go to make the 2S sigma and Let's look at nitrogen.

We've learned a bit about molecular orbital theory and the ways in which it differs from valence bond theory. But let's expand onocalized throughout the molecule, and atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals, which are also delocalized throughout the molecule. These can be sigma and pi bonding orbitals, or sigma star and in order to better understand molecular orbitals, check out this tutorial now. Otherwise, we simply need to understand that when two atomic orbital wave functions are combined, like these two S orbitals, there can be constructive interference where the peaks line up with the other peaks. This causes the amplitude to increase, which results in regions of greater electron density, while destructive interference results in regions of no electron density, which are depicted by these bonding and anti-bonding orbitals. We can do the same thing with P orbitals, utilizing direct overlap, which will yield sigma Px and sigma Px star molecular orbitals combining as follows, with the sigma bonding orbital and then pi bonding orbitals, followed by the corresponding anti-bonding orbitals. The good news is that these orbitals are still filled according to the outbout principle and Huns rule, like we already know.

Let's say it's time to cook dinner, and you put a pot of water on the stove to boil. As it begins to boil, some of the liquid water becomes steam. Let's say that rather than cooking up our pasta, we just allowed all of the steam, and we would find that it contains the same mass as the mass of the liquid water. Because when water molecules go from the liquid phase to the gas phase, nothing happens to each individual water molecule other than that they speed up and move away from each other. The pipe to the outdoor elements where it will come into contact with water from the rain and oxygen from the atmosphere, we know that this pipe will rust. And as a result, the rusty pipe will have more mass than it did originally. So we may at first think that matter has appeared out of nowhere to give the pipe more mass. But in actuality, the rust is. These are the kinds of observations we have made over the centuries that brought us to a better understanding of what our atmosphere is made of and how it can interact with different objects. The law of conservation of matter applies to many other everyday concepts, even if it's not always easy to see it in action. Say you eat a big burrito for lunch. Where does all that food go?\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey, it's Professor Dave. There's solid, liquid, and gas, and we use the complete ionic equation since all the components are dissociating.

What's left are the two ions that come together to form a solid precipitate, which is a chemical change.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey guys, it's Professor Dave nuclear force is what facilitates nuclear decay. These are instances in which the nucleus of an atom changes in some way. They are called nuclear were deflected in different manners. At the time, we didn't know about the subatomic particles the radiation was comprised of, so we just named them with Greek letters, and discovered their identities later. An alpha particle can be represented as helium or with the alpha symbol. An electron can be either an e or a beta symbol, and the atomic number will be negative 1, while the mass, though technically not 0, is negligible, so we call it 0. A positron will be the same nuclide symbol must be this. Again, the numbers on each side of the arrow add up to the same thing. Now that we are aware of these processes, why do they occur? It's always due to some instability in the nucleus. One reason might be that the nucleus is just too large. You see, the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by particles called mesons, is very strong, that the nucleus describes nucleons as existing in levels or shells. Kind of the way electrons do. As it happens, there are so-called magic numbers for each nucleon that correspond to a special type of stability. Kind of like a full valence shell of electrons. These are the magic numbers. In addition, most stable isotopes of a given element have even we said that protons and neutrons both weigh one atomic mass unit, even though technically the neutron is slightly heavier. Well, it is heavier by exactly the mass of the electron, which is why a neutron is neutral. It's a proton and an electron combined. So when the neutron becomes a proton, it will emit an electron in the process. A nucleus would do this is absorbed by the proton to give a new particle. And lastly, if a nucleus is in an excited state, it can emit a high energy gamma photon. In this process, there is one strikes a DNA molecule, it can potentially change the genetic code at that location, resulting in a potentially harmful mutation. Most elements have naturally occurring isotopes that do decay over time, even carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. So there are radioactive nuclei decaying all over your body every second. Here, C is the speed of light, which is very big. So what this equation says is that matter is simply extremely dense energy, the densest form there is. We have harnessed this power already with atomic bombs, much to the dismay of mankind. These worked by bombarding unstable uranium nuclei with neutrons, which caused them to split.

Let's talk about scientific notation and dimensional analysis. Humans like to count things. In the first civilizations, we had to count in order to trade goods with one another. Because we have 10 fingers, we based our counting on a system of 10. If we count apples, we can get to 9, but if we add one more, we put a 1 in the 10s place and then start building up the units place again. We can get that by moving the decimal to the right twice. 10 to the sixth, or a 1 with 6 zeros, is a million. So 5 times 10 to the sixth is 5 million. We can get this by moving the decimal over 6 times, adding zeros if we need to. We can also discuss very tiny numbers this way. 10 to the negative second means 1 over 10 squared, or 1 100th. So 3.5 times 10 to the negative 2 is 0.035. We can get this by moving the decimal over 6 times, adding zeros if we need to. We can also discuss very tiny numbers this way. 10 to the negative second means 1 over 10 squared, or 1 100th. So 3.5 times 10 to the negative 2 we use. We can apply them to any unit and they will do the same thing. To convert between units, we need to do dimensional analysis. Let's say we have a value in meters that we want to express in nanometers. We take the value we have and we multiply by a fraction that is equal to 1. We do this because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value. But the units cancel except seconds and we just multiply the numbers to get the answer. These are exactly the same length of time, just expressed differently. Let's check comprehension.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey it's Professor Dave, let's talk about kinetics. Kinetics is the study of reaction rates, or how fast a reaction goes. There are a lot of reasons why one chemical reaction might happen in the snap of a finger, and another might take a whole day. So let's learn about what those reasons might be. Reaction rates are generally measured as an increase the changing concentration of a substance. For example, if the product of a reaction is a gas, we can measure the changing pressure of the gas being produced. If a reaction goes from clear to a colored solution, we can monitor the light absorbance using a spectrophotometer. But whatever we do, we can use the data to plot concentration versus time. When reactant. Instead, if we double the concentration and the rate quadruples, the reaction is second order with respect to the reactant. And if a change doesn't affect the rate, it's zero order. The overall reaction order is just the sum of the orders from the individual reactants. So, if a reaction is first order with respect to each of two reactant at a time. By doing this, we can see the effect that one reactant's concentration has on the rate. Let's look at the reaction from before. We can clearly see that doubling the initial concentration of the reactant makes it disappear twice as fast. So the reaction is first order with respect to O2. So this must be the rate law. The reaction orders happen to match the stoichiometric coefficients, but this is a coincidence. It won't always be the case. Also, from the rate data, we can calculate the rate constant, just plug in the rate and concentrations from any this means that if you know the rate constant, you know the overall reaction order. Just see how many powers of molarity have to be in the numerator to result in a rate of molarity per second. If we want to discern the concentration at any given time, we can use the integrated rate law. We will us a straight line will tell us the overall reaction order simply by graphical analysis. Let's check comprehension.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey, it's Professor Dave. Let's talk about neutralization reactions. We know that acids will generate hydronium in aqueous solution, and bases will generate hydroxide in aqueous solution that can be neutral. Other solutions can also be neutral even if they contain a lot of hydronium ions and hydroxide ions. They simply need to be present in the acid and base are both strong. For example, as we can see here, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, if mixed in equal proportions, will generate water and sodium chloride. Furthermore, because hydrochloric acid has one proton and sodium hydroxide, like hydroxide, will generate a slightly basic solution, because hydroxide will completely deprotonate acetic acid, leaving the acetate ion, which is just basic enough to react appreciably with water molecules in solution, generating a small amount of hydroxide and making the solution weakly basic. as neutralization reactions. Let's check comprehension.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave again, let's revisit Vesper Theory. We've learned about valence shell electron pair repulsion theory, which is a theory that was developed to explain experimentally observed molecular geometries. It tells us that the central atom of a molecule can take some number of its typical 109.5 degrees we see for tetrahedral geometry, leaving us at 104.5 degrees. This is what we observe in nature, so water conforms perfectly to Vesper theory. That is the electron pair repulsion. This theory works well when the central atom is on the smaller side, like, its valence electrons are in the n equals 3 shell. So the electrons are in the n equals 3 shell.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey, it's Professor Dave, let's discuss the solubility of gases. We know that solutions involve one or more solutes that have been dissolved in some solvent. And typically-induced dipole interactions, which are rather weak. However, a molecule of oxygen is able to make much stronger interactions of this type than a helium atom effectively amongst the water molecules, which means a greater solubility. For this reason, we should also discuss the identity of the solvent, since that will make a big difference. Something like oxygen will be 20 times of solids in aqueous solution. This is in part because the resulting additional kinetic energy can push the molecules in the solid apart, but also higher temperatures increase the spontaneity of an entrop which reduces the solubility of oxygen and thus reduces the concentration of oxygen in these bodies of water. Aquatic life, like fish, need oxygen to breathe. So if enough oxygen escapes the water, many fish can die, which enter the solution, which results in a saturation of the beverage with carbon dioxide. This happens during the packaging of any can or bottle of soda. Then, once the container is opened at home, much of that carbon dioxide will quickly escape, which results in the familiar hiss we hear upon breaking the vacuum seal.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" He knows a lot about the science stuff Professor David explains. We know a lot about different kinds of ionic compounds and how they will behave in aqueous solution. Some are water soluble and will dissolve in water, while some are water insoluble and will remain solid in water and can also form as a precipitate if the individual ions involved find each, as this will be a spectator ion, which leaves us with the following net ionic equation, which exclusively shows the formation of the ion. This doesn't happen only in ammonia, this can happen in water as well.

It's the periodic table of the elements, which at first seems like a random arrangement of substances, most of which sounds strange and foreign. But the way the elements are arranged reveals many beautiful patterns that tell us about similarly is because they have the same number of valence electrons. Look at group 1, for example. These elements all have one valence electron, or one electron in their outermost shell. As you go down the table and end increases, you gain a shell each time, but whichever is the outermost shell, there is only one electron in it. Every element in group with the same electron configuration, will have their radii decrease as the atomic number increases. Next we look at ionization energy. This is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom. It will always be be greater than the first and continue to increase from there, since the more electrons you remove, the less stable the atom becomes. An element will have a huge jump in ionization energy after you take the last one in a shell, though oxygen has one additional proton. All deviations from the ionization energy trend can be explained by discrepancies in orbital symmetry like this one. Next we will look at electron affinity. This is exactly as well as ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity, which all go this way. Let's check comprehension.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Professor Dave here, I want to tell you about colloids. We've learned quite a bit about different kinds of mixtures. For example, we've learned about homogeneous mixtures involving ionic or covalent solids that disperse evenly in water or some other solvent to is called a colloid, or a colloidal dispersion. To illustrate the difference between a solution, a colloid, and a suspension, let's look at salt water, milk, and mud. The difference in particle size is what determines the different characteristics of any phase. Smoke is solid dispersed in gas. Clouds, fogs and mist involve liquid dispersed in gas. Milk, mayonnaise and butter involve liquid dispersed in liquid. Gellies and gels are liquids dispersed in solids. Phomes and whipped cream involve gas dispersed in liquid. So we get precipitation, which is what causes rain, sleet, and snow. There are also some solid substances that spontaneously form colloidal systems when mixed with water, like gelatin or starch. These substances contain particles that are already of colloidal size. The water simply disperses them. Another type of colloid will bear an electrical charge. In any particular system, all the colloidal particles will have the same charge, which helps keep the particles dispersed, since like charges repel one another. We take advantage of the formal charges on colloidal particles to remove them from a variety of mixtures. We can place charged electrodes in a colloidal dispersion and the charged colloidal particles to\", 'Chemistry'], [' He knows a lot about the number of different types of electrons. that is equivalent to any noble gas, it still correlates with a high degree of stability for the same reason that noble gas electron configurations are stable, as the valence shell is completely full.

If we make a couple simplifying assumptions about gases, we can make some easy predictions. Those are that, one, particles of a gas are dimensionless points in random motion, have been formulated into laws. Let's look at a piston. While keeping the moles and temperature the same, in other words, the same number of particles moving at the same speed, if we compress the volume, the pressure must go up. The particles will be hitting the sides more often because there is less distance to travel to hit a side. That means that pressure and volume are inversely proportional. If one goes to the other, the pressure will be hitting the lowest temperature possible, a complete absence of heat energy. This helps us avoid weird mathematical issues that would arise if we were doing a calculation involving a negative or zero temperature. To get Kelvin from Celsius, just add 273. To go the other way, subtract. The combined gas law is like a combination of boils and charles.

I want to tell you about wave particle duality. So let's take a break from atoms and look at something else. Light. For some time, we had known light to behave as an electromagnetic wave. For this reason, light is also called electromagnetic radiation. Light waves have both a wavelength, the distance from tip to tip, and a frequency, the number of waves that pass eject an electron depends only on its frequency and not its intensity. So if the beam was below a certain frequency, even a very intense beam with a lot of light could not eject an electron, whereas above a certain frequency, the faintest beam possible could do it. This It was found that the energy of a photon can be given by the following equation according to the frequency of the photon and Planck's constant. We now have to accept that light obeys wave particle duality, meaning it is both a particle and a wave at the same time. Confused? You should be. This is the first discovery in a series that brought about the quantum\", 'Chemistry'], [\" Hey, it's Professor Dave. Let's talk about colligative properties. A solution will behave differently from a pure solvent because there are particles of solute that interfere with physical processes like phase changes. A solution will display certain colligative properties, the key theme is that the presence of solute particles interferes with the activity of solvent particles at the interface between two phases. A liquid will always have a particular vapor pressure, since particles at the surface of the liquid can spontaneously enter the gas phase. The more solute there is, the more dramatic the effect. So the change in boiling point is given by the molality of the solution times a constant that is specific to the solvent. Freezing point depression is similar but deals with the interface between the liquid and solid phases. For a liquid to freeze, it has to form a lattice.

Three, leading zeros, ones that come before the first non-zero digit are not significant. And four, trailing zeros, the ones that come after the last non-zero digit, are only significant if they are decimal zeros.

Why do different liquids boil at different temperatures? To answer these questions, we have to learn about intermolecular forces. These are the electrostatic interactions between molecules. So when sodium chloride dissolves in water, the sodium ions make ion dipole interactions with the negative side of water's dipole. And the chloride ions make ion dipole and therefore very strong dipole-dipole interactions. We can almost think of partial charges as some fraction of a formal charge, so the greater the partial charge, the stronger the interaction so slightly partially negative and the other side is slightly partially positive. This is much weaker than a formal dipole but it still exists and can be measured A liquid's particles are moving, but they are still close together and interacting. Gaseous particles are moving and they are far away from each other, so compared to provide to melt and boil the sample. So let's take our three substances, slowly raise the temperature and energy we will need to pull the molecules apart and put them in the gas phase so they has just one polar bond, so that has a dipole.

This is what methane looks like. We know that this carbon atom is sp3 hybridized and therefore it's going to adopt this tetrahedral geometry. And we can drag this around and get everything, look at it from all angles so that I want to talk about some of the other molecular geometries. We know that within any electron domain geometry, there can be multiple molecular geometries. So what if we change this to a nitrogen and then let's get rid of a hydrogen. So that's ammonia. We've got NH3. Now the thing is just the look at this and it looks a little bit different, right? We can see that this is a little bit different than ammonia. We do see the bench shape, right? We see that bench shape very clearly because oxygen now has two lone pairs, one going away from us, one going towards us to retain that tetrahedral electron domain geometry. But the shape is going to be bent. And once again, we can get these bond angles and we might predict that it we wish and let's go ahead and minimize and that is going to be our geometry for PCL5. So we can clearly see that this has adopted a trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry. We can see this triangular plane and then the pyramid is extending on either side. So clearly the phosph SF4. Okay, we have SF4. Let's get the right geometry there. So that's what this is going to look like. And if we turn this thing around, we can see that it resembles, it's still very similar, right? But the difference is that we're missing this group over here because this is occupied by get and we call this T-shaped. So this is still sp3d hybridized. We know that that chlorine has seven valence electrons and so it's going to use three to make these covalent bonds and then it has two lone pairs. So let's zoom in there. Okay, so that is what we're looking at. This perfectly symmetrical situation. That is octahedral and any of these four, right? We can see this as sort down here. So that is going to repel the electron density just as it bond to an atom would and we're going to retain this overall configuration. So this is square pyramidal and we're looking at sp3d2 hybridized complexes. So it has eight valence electrons. It's going to use four for these four covalent bonds. But then it has two lone pairs left over. And because of the way those repel. Once again, you can construct any molecule you want. You can go over here and build it with carbon atoms or you can input whatever other elements you want. And then just go ahead and optimize it and it'll show you what the geometry must be for a small molecule or a large one as well.\", 'Chemistry'], [\" It's Professor Dave, let's discuss the properties of liquids. Now that we understand the phases of matter mean more kinetic energy, which causes the interm minimize their surface area. We can see this in a drop of water, it will retain a spherical shape. This is because the cohesive forces, the hydrogen bonds occurring between the polar molecules inside the droplet, are stronger than the adhesive forces between the water and the non-polar surface. But if we place a droplet on glass or another polar surface that will interact with water, it will spread out and maximize interactions with that surface, which in turn maximizes the interactions between the mercury atoms. This is why the mercury in a thermometer is curved in this manner. Another phenomenon that is related to cohesive forces is called surface tension. Surface tension is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of more dense than water. It is the strength of the cohesive forces between the water molecules that supports them. If an object like a bug were to pierce the surface of the water, some of the hydrogen bonds would have to be disrupted, as some of the volume would then be occupied by something other to water molecules, namely cellulose, which has lots of hydroxyl groups. So when a paper towel is dipped in water, the molecules will move upwards into the material to maximize the hydrogen bonding that is occurring. We can also see capillary action occurring when we dip a narrow and their interface with a solid surface, we are able to elucidate the concepts of viscosity, cohesive and adhesive forces, surface tension, and capillary action.\", 'Chemistry'], [' Professor Dave here, I want to tell you the history of atomic theory.

The nitrate ion is very stable, so its conjugate acid is indeed rather acidic, since the strength of an acid is proportional to the stability of its conjugate base. To name this acid, we follow a few simple steps. First, we begin with the name of the anion, in this case nit as HClO, HClO2, HClO3, and HClO4. We know that ClO3 minus is the chlorate ion, and ClO2 minus, with one fewer oxygens, will be the chlorite ion. If we want to specify that there is one less oxygen than that, we will use the prefix hypo. Most of these follow the rules precisely, but there are a few exceptions. For example, we will say sulfuric acid rather than sulfic acid. But the specific prefixes we use do follow the rules.

As we just learned, coordination compounds have some very interesting geometries, and many of these can't be explained using the same models that we use for normal covalent compounds, and this electron density will repel existing electron density on the metal ion. Due to this repulsion, the energy of certain d-orbitals will be increased and not in an equal manner. To understand why, same energy. In an octahedral complex, these two orbitals we mentioned have a higher energy as they point in the direction of ligands, and we refer to them as the EG orbit completely full. These are called high spin complexes. But if in a complex with strong field ligands, the difference in energy is very great. In such a case, the system the magnitude of the crystal field splitting energy or the difference in energy between the T2G orbitals and the EG orbitals. This in turn will determine the electron configuration and thus other characteristics of the complex, as is seen here, with different transition metal ions exhibiting totally different colors.

Carbon-14 forms in the upper atmosphere when nitrogen-14 collides with neutrons from cosmic rays in space, and although the vast majority of carbon is carbon-12, and gradually decreasing the amount of carbon-14 in the organism. And this process displays a half-life of 5,730 years. That means that if we find a wooden artifact made from a once-living tree, and then use a mass spectrometer to determine that the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in that artifact is half of what it is in a currently living tree, that object must be on Earth, since this particular nuclide has a half-life of 4.5 billion years.

Instead, a positive theory is one that's objective and fact-based, whereas a normative theory is subjective and value-based. Which brings us to the first of our three types of sociological inquiry. How about our friend here? sample is the same as the median income, $50,000, the mean will be over half a million dollars. Another type of evidence that sociologists use is qualitative data, or information that's not in numerical form. Where quantitative data try to measure, qualitative data try to illustrate or characterize. Sometimes the information that you need, can't or shouldn't be distilled into a number in a spreadsheet. Instead, you use descriptions of the world, gathered through interviews, questionnaires, and first-hand observation. Like, would. Because the fact is, subjects might change how they behave if they know they're being observed. For a really fun and fascinating example of this, let's go to the Thought Bubble. In the late 1920s, Austrian sociologist Elton Mayo went to a telephone factory known as the Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois. His goal was to help the Western Electric Company figure out how to make its all time periods. In other words, truth is not always objective. It's like when you tell someone about your favorite book, if you're trying to convince them that Harry Potter is objectively the best book series ever written, then you don't know what the word objectively means at all. There is no objective truth about what the best book is attitudes they hold about how the world works. And curiosity about a research topic often springs from these very values. Many researchers are drawn to the study of sociology out of a desire to understand moral or political questions about the subject.\", 'Sociology'], [\" The average American spends 13 and a half years of their life in school. And that's not counting the amount of time that you spend watching Crash Course. Getting a bachelor's degree means spending upwards of 17 years as a student, and advanced degrees, like medical degrees or PhDs, can tack on another four to six years on top of that. So why do we spend so much time in the classroom? With so much information available to us with just a few taps on our phones and computers, it might seem like sitting in a classroom to learn about the world isn't really necessary know. Historically, education was a privilege of the wealthy. In fact, the word school comes from the Greek word for leisure. Skollet. In ancient Greece, wealthy young men spent their free time learning from scholars like Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato. Nowadays, most high-income students in the US attend public schools, which start in kindergarten when children are five. And when I say public schools, this refers to schools funded through the government with taxpayer dollars. And of course, US public schools are organized into primary and secondary education to serve the widest swath of the student populace, what sometimes referred to as teaching the middle. So the 10% of American students who attend private schools might be there in search of a more rigorous education. Parents of kids with disabilities may also choose a private school that's specifically tailored to their child's needs, which may not be available in a public school. And it's worth pointing. Four-year institutions in the U.S. can either be public universities funded jointly by state taxes and student tuition or private universities, funded almost exclusively through tuition and private donations. The reason I keep talking about funding is that in the U.S. paying for college is one of the highest barriers to getting a post-secondary education. As a result, going to college is by no means a the basic facts about the world. It's pretty hard to get through the world without knowing how to read or write, and even for people who don't use math every single day, it's pretty useful to be able to calculate a 20% tip without needing to pull out a calculator. Another manifest function of schooling is socialization. By going to school outside the home, kids begin to learn norms and values to work in a certain field. You know that diploma you got when you graduated, or will get when you do graduate? That's documented proof of your credentials. And educational credentials are often used as a way of determining social status. They determine social placement by telling us who can access which jobs and how much they should be paid for that work. Recall that symbolic interactionist approaches explore how people create the world that we live in through their day-to-day interactions. In the context of education, we see this play out in how stereotypes created by society can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

But how do those three things actually interact in the real world? What does social stratification look like in the here and now? Or I guess I should say, what does stratification look like in the United States right now? For all the non-Americans watching, don't you worry, we will be getting to stratification around the world later.. So there's clearly some income stratification in the US. But how much? The households in the top quintile earn about 50% of all the income in the United States, and about 20% of all income is earned by the top 5% alone. And the bottom quintile? These households earn only 3.4% of the total income in the US. Those are pretty huge differences. And they get even bigger when we talk about wealth. First things first, levels also tend to vary by demographic groups. For example, women tend to have lower individual wealth levels than men. Married couples accumulate more wealth than people who are unmarried. And race and wealth are closely linked. The median wealth level of a white household is about 12 times that of a black household. One of the main sources of wealth for Americans is homeownership. White Americans are much more likely to own houses than black Americans. And the neighborhoods that got redlined were the ones where minorities, particularly black families, lived. Redlining was outlawed in 1968, but because homeownership is the major source of wealth for most Americans, neighborhood segregation and racial wealth inequalities are the legacies of policies like redlining. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Okay. So, on the money front, the US jobs you'd never work at. Those kinds of opinions are what the National Opinion Research Center, a think tank at the University of Chicago, was interested in when they created a ranking of occupational prestige. Top of the list? Surgeons% of those born in the top 4th of the income distribution have a 4-year college degree. For those born in the bottom 4th, only 9% do. As with wealth inequality, race and ethnicity are also linked with educational attainment. 22% of African Americans and 16% of Hispanic Americans have a 4-income families start school behind their peers, and those gaps only get wider as kids get older. Inequalities in one generation are often reproduced in the next generation. And as we've noted throughout this course, race and gender are closely linked to social status. There are lots of factors that play into these inequalities across groups, differences in education levels, differences in family composition, differences in occupation choice. Understanding why we see these inequalities across demographic groups is one of the foundational questions of sociology.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Over the last few weeks, you've heard me say many times that deviance isn't necessarily criminal. But of course, sometimes it is. Understanding crime sociologically means we need to answer some basic questions. Like, what is the nature of crime? Who commits crimes and why? And how does society respond to it? You,487 property crimes per 100,000 people. Those numbers are about half what they were in 1991 when crime rates peaked after a steady upward trend from about 1960. These numbers allow for some useful comparisons, but it's important to realize that they can't capture the whole picture. Because crime statistics are based on police reports, so they only include crimes that are reported to the police, and as we talked about last time, wealthy Americans aren't likely to be seen as criminally deviant in the same way that the poor are. This brings us to race and ethnicity, where disparities in arrests are clear. Despite making up only 13.3% of the population, African Americans make up 26.6% of arrests. There are a number of reasons for this. First, race and ethnicity are closely linked to wealth and social standing, and as we just saw, people of lower social class are more likely to be arrested. Second perception of crime, even when controlling for the actual crime rate. And this brings us to our third question. How society responds to crime? Over criminalization, after all, isn't a matter of who commits crimes, but of how society imagines who criminals are. Society's main institutional response to crime comes from the criminal justice system, which is composed of three parts in the US. The police and more uncooperative, even given the same behavior. The point here is that policing has a lot of aspects to it that are surprisingly subjective. Given this problem, we might expect the courts to help correct them by accurately adjudicating guilt and innocence, and sometimes they do. But in practice, how well they do their job is often a matter of who the defendant's guilty plea. In theory, this is a useful tool for quickly resolving simple cases and easing the burden on the courts. But while plea bargaining may be a negotiation, the parties aren't on even footing. A poor defendant stuck in jail because they can't make bail, represented by a public defender without the resources to adequately defend them, and facing the threat of a long jail sentence, is strongly incentivized to take a plea bargain, on crime policies like mandatory minimum sentences. And mass incarceration falls hardest on the poor and on people of color. Despite making up only 37% of the US population, non-whites make up 67% of the prison population. In 2015ed. Five years after release, three-fourths, 76.6% had been re-arrested. So these approaches to punishment don't appear to work as deterrence. Now, long sentences succeed in the criminal justice system and how that response ends with mass incarceration. Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C.

What is or isn't racist or who is or isn't racist is one of the most hotly debated issues in American society. Is racism about what you believe or is it about how you behave toward other races? What is prejudice and why does it exist? Sociology can't make racism go away and it can't make it any less disturbing. It probably can't even make the issue of race and racism less loaded than it already is. But it can, African American, and B, gaming the system. But both of these ideas are demonstrably false. The majority of people on welfare are white, and people who use social services like welfare are also likely to need the extra help. But these stereotypes lead people to claim that black Americans, particularly single mothers, are lazy or untrustworthy. This example is a specific type of prejudice, racial prejudice. Racism includes likely to mistakenly shoot an unarmed black man than an unarmed white man. This was true whether the participants in the study were white or black, and it didn't change regardless of what explicit biases the subjects said they had. What did seem to matter was if the subject said he or she was aware of stereotypes about black men and gun violence, even if the subjects adamantly disagreed with those stereotypes. That said, it does seem like training can make a difference. The concept of institutional racism was highlighted by civil rights activists Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton in the 1960s, who argued that institutional racism is harder to identify and therefore less often condemned by society. Carmichael and Hamilton compared society's response to the suffering caused by white terrorist bombing black churches to the lack of attention given to thousands of black children who suffered for different reasons, like from the lack of access to quality housing, food, healthcare, or schooling. Bomb, Thought Bubble. So that's what racism is. Now, why does it exist? One theory of prejudice is known as scapegoat theory, also known as frustration-aggression theory. Scapegoat theory frames prejudice as a defense mechanism on the part of frustrated people who blame another, more disadvantaged group for the troubles that they face, even when those troubles in a prejudice culture. This is what some people mean when they say, everyone's a little bit racist, that or they just like quoting Avenue Q. We learn racial prejudice and stereotypes through a kind of cultural osmosis. For example, American history textbooks tend to be written from a Eurocaucasian perspective and focus mainly on the contributions of white people rather than other cultures groups interact within a society are often described by sociologists in terms of four broad patterns. Pluralism, assimilation, segregation, and genocide. Pluralism is a state in which all races and ethnicities are distinct but have equal social standing. This isn't a society Brown-D-Borden education. But de facto segregation, or segregation due to traditions and norms, still remains. People live in neighborhoods, attend schools, and work mostly with people like themselves.

I'm not talking about atoms and molecules or wave functions and chemical reactions. I mean the world of people. For example, have you ever wondered who goes to college and why? What is it that makes people march in the streets? How do you know to raise your hand in math class but not at the dinner table? Why do some people like Broadway musicals and some people like hip hop and some people like both? Well, we're gonna find out about all of that stuff and so, so much more also very small. Want to see how from two people talking to differences between nations. It's this scope that really sets sociology apart, especially in what's known as the sociological perspective. And the sociological perspective means two things. One, it means seeing the general in the particular, and two, it means seeing the strange in the familiar. Seeing the general in the particular is a approach the everyday world as though you were seeing it for the first time, as if you were from another world. This is hard, but it's also incredibly important, and kinda cool. When we asked at the very beginning, why you raised your hand to ask a question in your math class, but not at your dinner table, that's a very small example of trying to see the strange in the familiar. And this is so hard to do, because your own society tends to look normal to you. You take it for granted. As you're socialized into it, you're taught a common sense understanding of society, and that's not a bad, marginalization, and power and inequality. If you imagine a map of society laying out all the different social groups and their relationships to each other, then your social location is your spot on that map. Your social location is a way of classifying yourself for race, social that draws our attention to another fact. The fact that there are many different kinds of power and many different kinds of inequality. There are, of course, the obvious kinds, like economic power and income inequality with political shocks too. This period saw the advent of mass democracy, the fall of kings, and the rise of the nation-state. This, combined with the rise of science as a discipline, was the context in which sociology arose. The first sociologists looked around at their quickly changing societies and were driven to try and scientifically understand them. We said earlier that society wasn't just big things like revolutions, industrialization, demographics. But it is also these things. It's both the big and the small, because they're related. Sociology is about understanding\", 'Sociology'], [\" For much of human history, all of the societies on Earth were poor. Poverty was the norm for everyone. But obviously, that's not the case anymore. Just as you find stratification among socioeconomic classes within a society like the United States, across the world you also see a pattern of global stratification, with inequalities in power of the merchant class. But the Colombian exchange worked out much less well for Native Americans, whose populations were ravaged by the diseases brought from Europe. It's estimated that in the 150 years following Columbus's first trip, over 80% of the Native American population died due to diseases such as smallpox and measles. The answer goes back to Max Weber's ideas about the Protestant work ethic. The Protestant Reformation primed Europe to take on a progress-oriented way of life in which financial success was a sign of personal virtue and individualism replaced communalism. This is the perfect breeding ground for modernization. And according to American economist Walt Rostow, modernization in the West took place, as it always tends to, in begins to bear fruit in the form of population growth, reductions in absolute poverty levels, and more diverse job opportunities. Nations in this phase typically begin to push for social change along with economic change, like implementing basic schooling for everyone and developing more democratic political systems. The last stage is known as high mass consumption, when your country is big enough that production becomes an emphasis on economic progress. But that isn't necessarily the only standard to aspire to. After all, economic progress often includes downsides, like the environmental damage done by industrialization and the exploitation of cheap or free labor. Finally, critics of modernization theory also see it as blaming the victim. In this view, the theory essentially blames poor countries for not being willing to accept change, putting Philippines, the Hawaiian Islands, and parts of Panama and Cuba. With colonialism came exploitation of both natural and human resources. The transatlantic slave trade followed a triangular route between Africa, the American and Caribbean colonies, and Europe. Guns and factory-made goods were sent to Africa in exchange for slaves who were sentiphery due to their closer ties to the global economic core. In Wallerstein's model, the periphery remains economically dependent on the core in a number of ways which tend to reinforce each other. First, poor nations tend to have few Sri Lanka now have flourishing economies. In direct contrast to what dependency theory predicts, most evidence suggests that nowadays foreign investment by richer nations helps not hurt poorer countries. Dependency theory is also very narrowly focused. It points the finger at the Today we learned about two theories of global stratification.

I mean, is it a smoothly functioning whole with different parts that fit together to keep it ticking? Or is it a jumble of different competing groups constantly at each other's throats struggling for control? Or maybe it's, you know, a bunch of people who are just trying to get through their days? The fact is, there isn't one answer to the question of what the nature of society really is. But all three of the models that I just described, society is a well- year was 5%, or Sam is 6 feet tall, or today a group of people with signs blocked the highway. By raw, I mean that these facts are just simple descriptions of empirical reality, and they don't come pre-interpreted. Is 5% an acceptable unemployment to ask. All sciences ask different kinds of questions and have different assumptions for answering them. And raw facts always need some kind of perspective in order to make them useful. Now, if we want to talk about different kinds of questions and perspectives in sociology we can turn to its main theoretical paradigms, of which there are three. There's structural functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism. Let's start with structural functionalism, which originated with a French sociologist named Emile Durkheim. Durkheim imagines society as a kind of organism, with different parts that all work together to keep it alive and in good health. Of course, things could go had, the additional purpose of creating workers who listen to authority and hit deadlines. That's a latent function. Now, along with functions, we also have social dysfunction, which is any social pattern that disrupts the smooth operation of society. Technological development is a powerful driver of economic improvement, for example, which is a useful function. But it's also a destabilizing force. New machines can put people out of work. Some days soon, we may see the classes based on their relationships to the means of production, things like factories and raw materials. Under capitalism, the two classes were the capitalists, or bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, and the workers, or proletariat, who must sell their labor to survive. Marx saw this conflict between classes as the central conflict in society, and the source of social inequality in power and wealth. But there are other conflict theories that reality can be created, but think back to the idea of raw facts versus interpretation. Waving my hand back and forth is a raw fact, but it only means that I'm waving hello to you because we've agreed to give it that meaning. For symbolic interactionism then, there is no big tea truth. Instead, it looks at the world that we create when we assign meaning to interactions and objects. A handshake is only a greeting because we agree that it is. A dog can be friend or food depending on what meaning\", 'Sociology'], [\" Social class in America can be hard to talk about, and not just because you may find it awkward to discuss who's poor and who's rich or who has more power and who has less. As sociologists, the difficulty for us is in pinning down exactly what we mean by social class. There isn't just one definition of it, and the definition you use will depend on what society you're interested in. If we go by Marx's definition, we have two classes, the bourgeoisie who own the means of production and the proletariat? Broadly speaking, American society can be split into five social classes. Upper class, upper middle class, average middle class, working class, and lower class. The upper class consists essentially of the capitalist of income earners. About two-thirds of the adults here have college degrees, and many have postgraduate degrees. It's almost a given that their kids will attend college when they grow up. Adults in this sector tend to have jobs that are considered prestigious, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and the like. Their families typically own homes and good school districts and are able to afford luxuries like travel and multiple vehicles. And it may not surprise you to learn that they're wealthy, at least compared to most Americans. This group is likely to have are associated with it, namely manual labor, which is why it's often referred to as the working class. Factory work, construction, manufacturing, maintenance work, all of these jobs generally fall under working class occupations, and while some working class jobs require technical skills, they don't usually require college education. It's important to note that working class jobs are more sensitive to how the economy is doing, because these jobs tend to be built help with health care. As of 2017, the federal poverty level for a family of four is $24,600, and 13.5% of Americans live in households below that. The government arrives at this figure by estimating the minimum annual pre-tax income that's needed to pay food, shelter, transportation, and clothing costs for a given household size. Of course, what's poor in the United States won't be the same as in another country. The US federal poverty line is a measure of relative poverty, poverty on a low wage income, which is partly why more than half of families in poverty are headed by single mothers. Higher rates of poverty among women, known as the feminization of poverty, is related to the increasing number of women who are raising children on their own and who work low wage jobs. But in addition to gender, you can also look at poverty by race. Contrary to popular belief, most poor Americans are not black. In fact, two-thirds of the poor in the US are white. documented how black Americans are much more likely to face institutional barriers to achieving economic success and are more likely to live in areas where jobs are scarce. He argues that in order to understand poverty, we have to look at wider economic and social structure, as well as the history and culture of racism in the US.

Prisoners in a prison are members of an involuntary group as our conscripted soldiers. Now that we understand a little bit about what groups are, we can start to study how they work, beginning with group dynamics, or the way that individuals affect groups and groups affect individuals. If we want to think about how individuals affect groups, a receive affection from their group's members. Finally, laissez-faire leaders do the least leading. They're extremely permissive and mostly leave the group to function on its own. This means lots of freedom, but it's the least effective style at promoting group solidarity and least effective in times of crisis. So leadership is one way that individuals affect groups, but groups also affect individuals. You can see this especially clearly in group conformity, a Confederate of the experimenter, and the shocks were not real. The experiment was designed to test how far the teacher would go in conforming to authority. At some point in the experiment, the Confederate would fade in extreme pain and beg the teacher to stop. Then he fell silent. If at any point the teacher refused to issue the shock, the experimenter would insist that he continue. In the end, 65% of participants went all the way, administering the presumably deadly 450-volt shock.

He's remembered as the father of divisive political movements, and his name is still sometimes thrown around in American politics as a kind of slur. But I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about Marx the philosopher. Marx the scholar. In the 19th century, a time defined by radical inequality and rapid technological and political change in Europe, Marx was concerned with one question. What does it mean to be free? Starting from this question, he said, and we must labor cooperatively in order to survive. As we labor, we change the world around us and gradually free ourselves from our natural constraints. But what Marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints, we entangled ourselves in new social constraints. Let's go to the Thought Bubble to explore this some more. Think about it like this. 10,000 years ago materialism because it's concerned with these questions of material reality. That is, how production is organized, and who has things like food or money, and who doesn't. Now, it's not that Marx didn't care about other things, like politics or religion, but he felt that they were secondary to the production and control of resources. And I don't mean secondary as in less important. I mean, secondary, because he internal combustion engine, but they also include cultural or social technologies, like the idea of the assembly line and mass production. The relations of production, meanwhile, define how people organize themselves around labor. Do people work for wages or does everyone produce and sell their own goods? How does ownership or property work? Is trade a central part of the economy? These are all questions about the relations of production. And these questions are important because if you think in terms of social constraints and surplus, the relations of production is as the inanimate part, the actual physical stuff that makes up the forces of production. So this includes everything from the land to stand on while you work to the raw materials you need, like trees and coal and iron ore, to the tools and machines you use. To simplify things dramatically, the proletariat are defined by the fact that while they work in the factories and use resources to make things, they don't own the factories or the things they make. Kabushwazi are defined by the fact that they do own the were crises of having too much. We reached a point where the forces of production were so developed that we could produce far more than we needed, but the vast majority of people couldn't afford to buy any of it. And so we had crises where the economy collapsed, despite the fact that there was more than enough to go around. Crises of overproduction are an example of what Marx saw in every mode of production, the contradiction between the forces of production and the relations of production. Marx understood history as a series of advances in the forces of production that created economic growth became precisely the things that caused crises. Marx saw this as an impasse that all modes of production eventually through hegemonic culture, a dominant set of ideas that are all pervasive and taken for granted in a society. While they're not necessarily right or wrong, these ideas shape everyone's understanding of the social world, blinding us to the realities of things like economic exploitation. But hegemonic ideas don't need to be economic ones. They could just as easily be beliefs about gender or race. And this points to possibly Marx's biggest impact. While Marx's model of history is specific to economic conflict, we can see it in the essence of the\", 'Sociology'], [\" As we noted last week, an armed robber and a pacifist have something in common. They're both social deviants. But they're obviously also really different. It's hard to imagine that some people resort to armed robbery for some of the same reasons that other people reject violence. That's why there are many different theories of deviants that can give us some perspective on how and why both the armed robber and the pacifist become deviant. Through sociology, we can explore how the either formally or informally. So this can range from a bank robber being sent to jail to someone being made fun of for the way they dress. Circum also said that these reactions bring society together, by reacting in similar ways to something that seems not normative, or basically affirming to each other that we're and us, and the deviants are them. And this isn't necessarily a by way of conventionally approved means. Go to school, get to grades, graduate, get a good job, work hard, get rich, success, right? Well, of course, even if wealth is your goal, this approach isn't an option for a lot of people. Many who are raised in poverty, for instance, lack a realistic path to prosperity. And if you don't have access to the means, like money for an education or good paying job opportunities, then the goal will be elusive too. And that's what we're talking about. In this case, a strong sanction could make the student start to think of herself as a truant. And this can lead to what Irving Goughman called a stigma, a powerfully negative sort of master status that on a person's self-control as a way of avoiding deviance, as well as their ability to anticipate and avoid the consequences of their actions. All of powerful are able to defend themselves against labels of deviants. So deviant actions are less likely to lead to a deviant label, and thus reactions to that deviant. Finally, conflict theory points out that norms have an inherently political nature, but the politics tend to be masked by the general belief that if something is normative, it must be right and good. So while we may take issue with how a law is applied, we much more rarely ask whether the laws themselves are just or not. Conflict theorists see these explanations at work wherever the inequality of social\", 'Sociology'], [\" Class matters. You probably already know that and not only because you're a student of sociology, but because you're a person who lives in a society. But do you know how much it really matters? Social class is a huge determinant of many of the most fundamental aspects of modern life, from your education to your beliefs, as well as your values, your occupation, your income, and not only how you live, but also how you die. So let's talk about how class plays found in her research on parenting styles. Let's go to the thought bubble to look at how social class can affect what kind of parent you are or what kind you have. In the 1990s, Lero's research focused on observing families of elementary school students from upper middle class and working class backgrounds. In doing this, she realized that parents had very different approaches to how they educated and disciplined their kids. She found that upper middle class parents tend to be very involved in their kids' social, and lower-class Americans being more likely to be the opposite. Even religion varies by class. Upper-income Americans are more heavily represented in liberal Protestant groups like Episcopalians, Presbyterians, as well as Judaism, Hinduism, and Atheism, whereas lower-income Americans are more likely to identify as evangelical Protestants or Catholics. But beliefs and values aren't the local level. So kids who grow up in affluent neighborhoods tend to have access to better schools because those communities provide more funding. So living in a better neighborhood tends to mean access to better educational facilities as well as to technology like computers, good teachers, and a wider variety of classes and extracurriculars. And that's assuming you go to a public school. Upper-class children are more likely to attend private schools, and this trend continues when we that inequality will get passed on to a new generation. And of course, political and economic power tend to be concentrated among those at the top of the social class ladder. Dreaming of being president when you grow up? Of the 10 presidents who have held office in the last 50 years, six attended an Ivy League school for either their undergrad or post-grad studies. Every single one had at least a bachelor's degree. So education can seem less like the great equalizer in this by different people? Or is it a systematic pattern that links class with eating habits? Well, oftentimes, unhealthy foods are cheaper, both in terms of money and time. Lower-class Americans tend to have less leisure time and less money to spend on cooking healthy meals. After all, it takes a lot less time and money to pick up McDonald's than to spend an hour cooking a meal in the United States. First, the beliefs and values parents pass on to the next generation will vary by class. Second, there are class gaps in educational attainment which help perpetuate inequality across generations. And finally, Americans of lower socioeconomic status tend to have worse health and shorter life spans than those with higher class status. Next time, we'll focus on\", 'Sociology'], [\" If you asked a medieval peasant whether they liked working two days a week for their lord while they barely made enough food for themselves, they'd probably say no. And if you ask a factory worker today whether they like making a tiny fraction of what their company's CEO makes, they'd probably have a similar answer. But even though huge numbers of people don't want inequality, it still exists, and it has for a long time. And the systems of stratification that we talked about last week don't really help explain this. They can tell us why inequality never goes away, but it doesn't, on its own, explain why we have unequal societies in the first place. For that, we have to turn to our three paradigms. From a structural functionalist perspective, we have social stratification because, well, you know the basic story of structural functionalism by now, so say it along with me. We society, but it's not a particularly high-paid, socially valued job. And this mismatch works the other way, too. Not all highly paid jobs are functionally important. For instance, ask yourself, who is more functional for society? A high school teacher or a famous actor? Now think about who gets paid more. Finally, Davis and Moore also ignore the fact that not all paths are inequality that came with it. But one of the central criticisms of the social conflict understanding of stratification is that the proletariat revolution never happened in Western Europe or the United States. If inequality was so bad for workers, why did the does not. There are more criticisms of Marx than just an absent revolution, and one of the more fundamental ones was made by none other than Max Weber. Specifically, Weber argued that Marx's of do in the form of conspicuous consumption. This is one of the products that you buy, make statements about your social position. Buying a really nice bottle of wine for a dinner party or wearing designer sunglasses isn't just about the thing itself. It's also about sending a message to anyone who sees it, a message that says, I'm in the upper class. The objects act as sign vehicles, carrying meaning just like a on your music, your friend might recognize you as a person like them, if they share your tastes. Or maybe they don't recognize you as being like them, so they judge you for being pretentious. And this isn't because classical music is special somehow. It's true regardless of what kind of music you put on, and applies just as much to the clothes you wear, the books you read, and all of your other tastes. These are all ways in which people categorize you in the hierarchy how stratification works, but why we have it. Today we learned about different theories of stratification. We talked about ideology and how it helps stratification reproduce itself. We discussed structural functionalism with the Davis Morphesus and its problems. We talked about Marx's understanding of classes and vapors criticisms. And we saw how symbolic interactionism helps explain stratification in everyday life.

After all, most people will tell you that sex is private, not something that people generally talk about, at least not in can mean a lot of different things. Like, it can mean having different combinations of sex chromosomes as in it comes to gender, those distinctions are all about society. Gender is the set of social and psychological characteristics that a society considers proper for its males and females. The sets of characteristics assigned to men are masculinities, and those assigned to women are femininities. A lot of people have a hard time understanding the difference between the sexes, there's a great deal of overlap, too. Plenty of women are bigger and stronger than plenty of men, and minor differences in average size and strength can't explain why some occupations have been stratified by gender. The reality is that minor, average biological differences are used as the justification for widespread gender stratification, funneling males and females into different jobs, hobbies whose gender identity doesn't match the biological sex they were assigned at birth. By contrast, cisgender people's gender identity matches their biological sex. Still, both trans and cis people can express their identity in a variety of ways, conventional or otherwise. And this should make it clear that gender, like sex, is not binary. There are many ways of doing them in entities and many ways in which a person can be masculine. Now that we've on the surveys we do have, around 4% of the American population identifies as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. However, this increases to around 10% if we ask instead whether a person has ever experienced same-sex attraction or engaged in homosexual activity. So, what can each of the three sociological paradigms tell us about sexuality? We'll start with symbolic interactionism because its insight is the most fundamental, and that is that sexuality, this intensely private and supposedly primeval thing, is socially constructed sex means when it happens. The idea that sex happens at home between two willing partners, for example, is part of a generic sexual script in our society. Likewise, sex with happens between two people who met at a bar might come with a different script and, therefore, different shared expectations than sex between two people who've known each other for a long time. This brings us to the structural functionalist perspective. Since sexual reproduction is necessary for the reproduction of society, this view makes heterosexuality seem like it's directly linked to biological sex, but heterosexuality is just as much as social construction as any other sexuality. It's defined by dominant sexual scripts, privileged by law, and normalized by social practices like religious teachings, so it comes to be understood as natural in a way that other sexualities are not. Queer theory challenges this naturalness, and especially shows how gender and a little bit about how it works. Finally, we talked about sexuality and sexual orientations and what the three paradigms of sociology can tell us about them. Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C.

If you're American, there's a pretty good chance that you do. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015, 87% of those surveyed identified themselves as middle class. That's a pretty big middle. But your intuition about what the middle class is, like who it includes So what if the way I am defining poverty isn't how you're imagining poverty? What if we're all seeing different levels of well-being as poor, but we refer to them all as poverty? That won't work. So you have to define your concepts, which becomes even more important when you decide to use Facebook relationship status as your measure of relationship status among your subjects. For your measurement to be reliable, you have to be consistent in how you measure the variable. So here's what NOT to do. Say you have two categories for relationship status. Single or not single. Two different sociologists are going through the data assigning values based on Facebook status. One decides that people who say it's complicated get the label not single while the other decides that these people should be called to misinterpret a correlation to conclude that one thing causes the other when it really doesn't. For example, murder rates tend to be high when ice cream sales are high, but it's ridiculous to think that more ice cream causes more violence or vice versa. What's missing is a third variable. Heat. More people commit crimes during hot months and more people buy ice cream than too. Okay, once you have your hypothesis and you know what types dependent variables, like earnings, education, and health outcomes. In an experiment, if the change you predicted occurs for the experimental group, but not for the control group, then your experiment supports your hypothesis. And in the HUD experiment, sociologists compared how the measures of well-being changed for the control group compared to those for the experimental group. One of the findings, those who received a voucher had better mental health outcomes, such as Tons of sociology research is done in the field. Through our third method, participant observation. Participant observation is when researchers observe people by joining them in their daily routines. The result of this type of research is called an ethnography. Researchers try to integrate themselves into a community, hanging out with their subjects, working with them, and so on. They're both observers and participants. This type of data collection tends to be exploratory and descriptive. You're a must. This means that your subjects must know you're observing them and must be made aware of any risks that they take by being a part of your study. Not all research methods require you to interact with your subjects, though, or even collect your own data. Many sociologists analyze existing sources of data collected by others. The most common of these sources is government agencies, which collect statistics on income, health, education, employment, marriage, fertility. I could keep going. The point study, a researcher will use both to develop theories about the social world. And guess what? You're done! Today we discuss the research method.

It's also the title of the episode, you probably saw that. Each of us is surrounded by people, and those people become a part of how we act and what we value. This is known as socialization, the social process through which we develop our personalities and human potential and learn about our society and culture and guardians are your first teachers of everything, from the small stuff like how to brush your teeth to the big stuff like sex, religion, the law, and politics. The games they play with you, the books they read, the toys they buy for you all provide you with what French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu called cultural capital, the non-financial assets that help people succeed in the world. Some of this cultural capital may seem fairly innocuous. I mean, is reading Good Night Moon really making that big of an impact all examples of anticipatory socialization. That's the social process where people learn to take on the values and standards of groups that they plan to join. Small children anticipate becoming adults, for example, and they learn to play the part by watching their parents. Gender socialization teaches boys to be a man and girls to be a woman, but children also learn through secondary socialization. That's the process through which children become socialized outside the home, within society at people from many backgrounds teaching you about race and ethnicity, social class, disability, gender and sexuality, and more. School becomes not just a classroom for academic subjects, but also for learning about different kinds of people. And of course, schools are also where kids are exposed to one of the most defining aspects of school age at schools where good grades made you popular. Thanks Thought Bubble. Now, Coleman's study might seem like common sense. Of course, you and your friends are gonna be pretty similar. Don't we choose to be friends with people who are like. For example, studies have found that kids exposed to Sesame Street in randomized control trial settings reported more positive attitudes toward people of different races, most likely a result of the program's wide variety of characters from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. TV also affects us well beyond childhood. One recent study found that MTV's 16 and pregnant may have acted as a cautionary group, making them more willing to value self-sacrifice if their unit is in danger.

But have you ever wondered how this enormous flow of goods is organized so that stuff made in China is available in stores in rural Montana? It happens because formal organizations make it happen. Our world is structured by formal organizations and life as we now know it can't exist without them. But it's not all rainbows and butterflies and incredibly extensive trade networks because people join them to pursue some goal that they think is morally worthwhile. This includes charities like the Red Cross, but also political parties and religious organizations. Finally, coercive organizations are ones where you don't have a say in whether you're a member or not. People are coerced into joining these organizations, often as punishment as in prisons or treatment, say through involuntary in episode nine, but to recap, its members each have specialized rules that fit together in a hierarchy, that is, a clear chain of command linked by formal written communications. Members of a bureaucracy also complete their work with technical competence, treating colleagues and customers without regard for their individual or that their goals change. Their hierarchies create another problem. The problem of oligarchy, or the rule of the many by the few. Now, of course, a hierarchical organization is going to be an oligarchy. After all, in a hierarchy, the people at the top make decisions for everyone else to carry out. This is partly what Weber thought helped make bureaucracy so efficient. But in a lot of bureaucracies, like democratic and ignore the rule, they're doing their job wrong. To be a good bureaucrat is not to think for yourself, but to be a good cog in the machine. Despite all these problems, we still see rationalization all over the place, including in the workplace, through what's known as scientific management. Scientific management is a system devised by American engineer Frederick Taylor, who in the early 1900s sought to make industry work more efficiently. He came of technical competence, it's important to understand that that's not how those doing the hiring saw it. Often, they believed that those who were excluded were simply incapable of doing the work. Until they were forced to do otherwise by changes in the organizational environment, many were quite happy to go on excluding large swaths of their talent pools. More recently, another challenge has come in the form of big economic shifts and the changing nature of work itself. As anything, it continues to spread. Sociologist George Ritzer has called this the McDonaldization of Society, the process by which the principles of the fast food restaurant have come to dominate the whole of society. Few things, after all, are more hyper-rational than fast food. The whole industry is based on the principles of efficiency, predictability, uniformity, and control. The point of fast food is that you get your food quickly, and just as you expect it. And that's because about the negative consequences of rationalization in organizations.

That's supposed to mean that family relationships, blood, are stronger than all other relationships. Which, I guess, are the water. But what do you think? Is that true? Can friends be considered your family? Or do you only think of your parents or siblings as family members? And how strong are familial relationships? Do they come with obligations that you don't have for other people? Let's try to tell the blood from the water here and figure, for example, but other family relationships are created through legal bonds, like marriage or adoption. And it's also important to recognize that for many people, family is a matter of choice. Marriage is the most prominent example of this, choosing to get married as two people coming together to say to each other and the world that they choose to be a family. Another family by choice is when close friends are also considered family, a practice called fictive kin. These family friends are referred to as immediate family, parents and siblings. Extended family is everyone in your family who isn't a parent or sibling. Grandparents, uncles, cousins, great aunts, third cousins twice removed. In the United States, most people live with their immediate family, though they may live nearby or regularly visit members of their extended family. And in many cultures, including the US, families most often form around marriages. Marriage is a legally recognized a higher socioeconomic status. Traditionally, women are more likely to use marriage to move up the socioeconomic ladder than men, partially due to broader patterns of gender inequality that limit other opportunities for improving their status. And forms of marriage can vary across time and across cultures. In modern-day high-income countries, marriage is, by law, only between two people, a practice known as monogamy. Polygamy, or marriage between two or more spouses, is legally recognized in the majority of African,153 cultures, cultural anthropologists David Levinson estimated that about 70% have a patrolocal resonance pattern. This was most common for societies with frequent warfare, where families wanted to keep sons around as a form of protection. But in some pre-industrial societies, our newly married couple will practice matrolochality, where they live with or near the wife's family. Many Native American tribes, particularly those in the southwestern United States such as the Hopi and Zuni, have historically been mat of parents, a practice known as neolocality. While patrilineal traditions, like passing on the father's last name to children, persist, most families in industrial societies trace descent through both men and women. This continues to be might think it's a good thing that family status ties prevent incest, but historically this sexual regulation has also meant that married women have been seen as the sexual and father as breadwinner shape how people think about themselves and others as good or bad fathers and mothers. Social exchange theory argues that relationships are a form of exchange between people, attempts to gain benefits from their interaction while avoiding the costs. If the costs outweigh the benefits, the marriage ends.

These terms are outdated, inaccurate, and frankly insulting ways of talking more than 100 countries that fit the label of third world, but they have vastly different levels of economic stability. Some are relatively poor, but many aren't. So, lumping Botswana and Rwanda into the same category, for example, doesn't different from what you'd expect in a high-income country. Now, you might notice that I keep talking about how urban these types of countries are. Why does it matter how many people live live in these countries, and their economies are mainly based on agriculture. Not only do these countries face income poverty, they also have greater rates of disease, worse healthcare and education systems, and many of their citizens lack access to basic needs like food and clean water. Here, 8% of children die before the age of 5, and among older children, more than one-third never finish primary school. This type control the fruits of their labor. Quite literally, even though women in low-income countries produce 70% of the food, men own the land that the women's labor is done on. 90% of the land in poor countries is owned by men. And the poverty of children and the poverty of women are connected, specifically by reproductive healthcare. Poor access to reproductive healthcare is part of the reason that resources.

That five-year-old girl was Anna. She was unwanted by the family she was born into and was passed from house to house among labors and strangers for the first six months of her life. Eventually, she ended up being kept in a shed with no human contact other than to receive food. Kingsley Davis observed Anna for years after her rescue and wrote about the effects of this upbringing on her it. But then we develop the ego and super ego to balance the id. Ego is the voice of reason. Your conscious efforts to reign in the pleasure-seeking id. And your super ego is made up of the cultural values and norms that you internalize and use to guide your decisions. So if the id is the devil on your shoulder, the super ego is the angel on the other shoulder, and the ego is the mediator who intervenes when the angel and devil start fighting. Now, a lot of Freud's work hasn't stood the test of time. But thinking about the world is pretty much limited to how they think about the world.

If they love playing with trains and you ask them what their dad's favorite thing to do is, they'll probably say that he loves playing with trains too. It's not until they reach the concrete operational stage, around six or seven, that they develop the ability to take in other people's perspectives and begin to make cause and effect connections between events and their surroundings. And in the formal operational stage,'s right may not always line up with these principles. Sure, laws against stealing candy may be just, but what about laws that say only certain people can get married? Just because something is a law, is it right? How you feel about that question may depend on your socialization. And on your gender! Carol Gilligan, an American psychologist who started out as a research assistant and collaborator of Colberg's, explored how girls and boys experience these stages differently. She realized that Colberg's original we are through other people. All social interactions require you to see yourself as someone else might see you, something need described as taking on the role of others. In the first stage of development, according to Mead's model, we learn through imitation. We watch how others behave and try to behave like them. You see your mom smile at your neighbor, so you smile too. And Mead observed that as kids got older, they moved on to a new stage, play. Rather than just imitating your you, you keep growing well past high school.

It helps us understand every aspect of society, even those that we think are strictly personal, like religion, sex, and gender. And the same is true for another aspect of your personal life. Your health, and how you take care of it. Many of the the Thought Bubble for a brief jaunt through the history of Western medicine. The so-called father of Western medicine was an ancient Greek by the name of Hippocrates. Yes, the same Hippocrates that we get the Hippocratic oath from, credited as one of the first Western physicians to believe that disease was the result of that the body was separate from the mind and the soul. And this allowed a scientific model of medicine to emerge, applying the scientific method to study and treat disease. In the same way that you can study an engine, the thinking goes, you can also study anatomy and physiology. And yeah, there's a crash course for that. And just as you can fix an engine when it breaks down, if you understand what'sus or diabetes don't manifest with easily noticeable symptoms, which means that people who seem visibly healthy may still be sick. Sociologist Talcott Parsons, working within a structural functionalist framework, described the social and cultural responses to disease through the concept of what he called the sick roles. Sick roles are the behaviors associated with having an expected of well people. But if people don't perceive you as being properly sick, you might not get the same amount of slack. This is why people who have invisible illnesses are often dismissed as just being lazy. Of course, not everyone with the disease plays a sick role one isn't always clear. For example, there are shifting definitions of what constitutes a disease. Usually it's defined as a structural or physical dysfunction of the body. Now, another way a medical sociologist approach health is to look at illness. It's sometimes said that a person walks into a doctor's office with symptoms but leaves with a disease. While a disease defines a dysfunction of the physical, an illness is the social and cultural response to a disease. And your perception of illness is likely to make them admit that they're really sick. More broadly, institutions within health services, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies play a major role in defining illness responses by one, defining what constitutes a disease, and two, shaping who has access to treatment. All patients are not created equal in the US healthcare system, which patients get quality care varies by social group and by how much our society values certain diseases.\", 'Sociology'], [\" A person can be healthy, but can a country be healthy? Population health indicators measure the distribution of health throughout a given population. These kinds of indicators are what sociologists use to study patterns and health outcomes across different social groups. Because, like all things sociological, we want to understand the wider patterns of health. So if you're trying to figure out your own risks for a disease, it might be useful to. The average number of years an individual can be expected to live. And you can use life expectancy to get a better understanding of what kind of person tends to live longer, which is a pretty good proxy for the overall health of a community. For example, in the United States, and for that matter, almost every other country on the planet, women tend to outlive men. For men in the United States, the all, if people are living a lot longer, there are going to be more people who are living past childbearing age. This would make the birth rate go down even if the number of kids each generation has stays constant. Because of this, we might use what's called a total fertility rate. The number of live births for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44. Total fertility rates let us compare birth patterns across generations. A larger generation might have more kids, after all, more parents means more kids, but we might also care about who is leaving us, too. Mortality rates are death rates in a given population, and they can tell us a lot about its overall health. For example, infant mortality rates are often a key indicator of a group's health. Because infants are especially vulnerable to disease and malnutrition, their mortality rate tells us something about broader issues, like poverty levels and availability and quality of food, water, and health services. For example, black Americans are more than twice as likely as white likely to die from homicide than other groups. Grilling down into this data a little more, we can also understand population health by looking at the types of diseases that different groups are susceptible to. Morbidity refers to the presence of disease. While morbidity rates tell us something about the frequency of disease within a given population. Diseases can also be co-morbid, meaning that two diseases co-exist in a person at the same time. Co-morbidity rates tell us how common it is for people in a population to have any two diseases at one neighborhoods. But it can be hard to separate the effects of something like pollution from other aspects of where a person lives that might also affect their health. People who live in poorer neighborhoods are more likely to be exposed to more pollution. So is it they disproportionately affect less educated and minority Americans. And low-income Americans are also more likely to experience social environments at pose health risks. For example, the amount of stress a person is under can have a big effect on both their mental and physical well-being. And these groups are more likely to live or work in high-stress environments, like neighborhoods with higher crime rates or unfulfilling jobs with long hours.

Women are particularly underrepresented in leadership positions across all major institutions. Of the Fortune 500 companies, only 32 CEOs are women. In politics, only 19% of the US House of Representatives and 21% of the US Senate leave the workforce to care for children, which is way more normative for women than for men. So some people argue that if we can explain the gender gap by looking at people's choices, then it must be the people alone who are responsible for the gap being there. But the fact is, society has a tremendous influence on what choices people make but holding all else equal, men are more likely to be tried for a crime and more likely to be found guilty. This stems from the stereotype that women are more moral and innocent. An example of benevolent sexism that makes women less likely to be seen as criminal types.

To think traditionally is to take the basic setup of the world as given. In other words, traditionalism sees the world as having a basic order, and that order is the way things ought to be. We can see this very clearly in feudalism and divine right monarchies. The monarch is in how people think? What kicked off this process of rationalization? Faber gave here what might seem like an unlikely answer. Religion. In his book, The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism, Faber argued that the transition change it. You're either one of the elect or you're not. So how do you know hierarchy of positions with an extremely clear chain of command. This hierarchy is made up of many very specialized roles and is held together by formal written communications. The people in the bureaucracy accomplish their work with technical competence according to detailed rules and regulations, and they do it without regard to the particular people they're serving. In other words, they do it imperson the commands of a charismatic leader because of the extraordinary characteristics of that person. So the modern state is an apparatus of rules, which are ultimately directed by a group of charismatic leaders. In the US, for instance, when we go to the polls every four years, we're making a choice about who's going to direct the bureaucracy, and we make that choice based on the characteristics of the people running. And here's another one of Weber's major contributions to sociology. The idea that the people who can turn their fame or status into political power. Unlike Marx, Weber didn't take a particularly critical stand on stratification in society, but that doesn't mean he didn't see its problems. For Weber, rationalization was the defining feature of the modern age, and he was deeply worried about it. Remember, rationalization is about three things, calculability, methodical behavior, and reflexivity. But it's really easy to lose reflexivity, to stop social stratification in the modern state, and we saw why Weber was so worried about the modern world.

People with different interests, different amounts of money, members of different subcultures, races, and sexual orientations somehow all manage to hold together in this thing we call society. A thing that, at least, kind of, works. But it doesn't just hold together. Society has to somehow endure periods of intense change without falling apart. Political change, technological change, population growth, economic crises, all these things can be massively disruptive. Durkheim was concerned with the question of what kept societies together so that he could make sure that his didn't fall apart again. And this was the task of sociology as he understood it. Sociology was to be a truly scientific study of society. With it, we could understand its normal and abnormal functioning. We could diagnose how it was changing, and we could deal with the consequences. To Durkheim, sociology was to society what biology and medicine were to the human body. He actually thought of society as a kind of book, Rules of Sociological Method, too. The point is, the specific explanation for the behavior in this family doesn't really matter. What's important is that we can see here the power of a social fact, even in this situation where no one directly involved believes in it. If that's not an, you might wish you didn't have to sleep, but that doesn't make sleeping a disease. It's just a normal part of the way the human body works. And just like sleep, Dirkheim argued that crime serves a purpose. For example, he said that crime helps strengthen the common consciousness. To him, crime and traditional societies, like those of feudal Europe, were highly socially integrated. People knew their place in society, what that place meant, and how they related to other people. But modern society, over the preceding century, had suffered from a loss of social integration. The decreasing importance of religion and of other traditional ways of place that they were lacking. Now, many sociologists today see that Durkheim's work on suicide was undermined by the poor quality of statistics at the time. But still, he used those statistics in new ways, as evidence and tests for theories of society. And you can see in his research how Durkheim tried to answer big questions. Society is composed of social facts and bound together by common consciousness. This normal functioning can evolve, but it can also be disrupted by rapid change. And that, Durkheim believed, is where sociology steps in. By studying society scientists,\", 'Sociology'], [\" Where are my ladies at? Seriously, we've spent a lot of time learning about the origins of sociology and all of the founders we've talked about so far have been met. That's because when sociology was becoming an academic discipline, women didn't have the same access to education. In fact, it was considered improper in the 19th century for women to write articles and give talks to the public. And this continued for decades, with some of the top universities not allowing female students until the 1970s. Which sucks. But it also raises anheimer Weber who are hailed as the forefathers of sociology and get entire chapters devoted to their theories, Martynow typically gets at most a couple of sentences in a textbook. Martynow started out kind of like the crash course of her time, bringing research to the masses and easily digestible bites. She wrote a of women. Despite the title of her second book, How to Observe Morals and Manors, it was not a guide to etiquette. It was a treatise on research methodology describing how to do cross-cultural studies of morals and moral behavior. Martyno talked about interviewing, sampling, bias, and observation, the problem of generalizing from individuals to a whole society, many of the 19th and early 20th century, the first wave of feminism focused on women's suffrage, or the right to vote, and other legal inequalities. That's because in the 19th century, all property and money that a woman had legally belonged to her husband. Imagine that. Not being able to earn a salary that was your own. Not being able to own land. Not being able to write a will sex. Sex refers to biological distinctions between females, males, and intersex individuals. The gender refers to the personality traits and social roles that society attaches to different sexes. Think about it this way. Do men and women Ania Woman Hooks Rights, the process begins with the individual woman's acceptance that American women, without exception, are socialized to be racist, classist, and sexist, in varying degrees. That's a heavy statement. Most people don't think of themselves as racist or sexist, but one of the underlying ideas behind work was one starting point from which the waves of feminism unfolded. Today we learned about Harriet Martynow and gender conflict theory. We also explored the three waves of feminism as well as intersectionality. Next time, we'll look at another important figure in sociology, Max Weber.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Why is gender even a thing? We've talked about what gender is and how it affects people's lives, but we've skipped over a fundamental part of the whole issue of gender. Why does it matter to us so much? Gender isn't the same in all cultures. Mainstream Western ideas have focused on the idea of gender as a binary, with masculinity and femininity serving as mutual opposites. But other cultures have three genders, or see gender as fluid, or describe gender as a that help keep society organized and functioning. From this perspective, gender is a means of organizing society into distinct roles that complement each other. Some anthropologists have argued that hunter-gatherer societies originated the idea that men are providers and women take care of the home. Men were physically stronger and didn't have the demands of childbearing, which made it easier for them to take on more sets, and gender gives us a way of pairing off these skills. In society, in turn, encourages gender conformity by making people feel that they have to fit these molds if they want to be romantically desirable, and by also teaching people to reject those who go against these gender norms. Though this theory was influential in the mid-20th century, it's fallen out of favor for a few reasons. First, Parsons was basing his theory on a all of society work well, symbolic interactionists are more focused on how gender is part of day-to-day life. From this perspective, gender is something that a person reinforce gender stratification. But a limitation of the symbolic interaction approach is that it focuses on, or the analysis of the interplay of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and other identities, which often results in multiple dimensions of disadvantage. While all women are disadvantaged by gender, it's also true that some women experience more disadvantaged than others, and the con of social equality for all genders, in opposition to patriarchy and sexism. Broadly speaking, feminism advocates the elimination of gender stratification, expanding the choices that women, men, and other genders are allowed to make, ending gender-based violence, and promoting sexual freedom. There are many forms that feminism can take, but let's highlight three major schools of thought within feminist theory. The first is liberal feminism, and no, I don't mean liberal in the political sense. I mean liberal in the classical sense, are only a few of the many views on how best to advocate for gender equality. Kind of like how there are many theories within sociology about how we should think about gender. Today we learned about three of those schools of thought on gender theory. Structural functionalism sees gender as a way of organizing society and emphasizes the ways that men and women can act as compliments to each other. Symbolic interactionism looks at gender on the micro level, exploring how gender guides day-to-day life. And gender conflict theory, intersection theory,\", 'Sociology'], [\" Everyone loves to go to rags to riches story. Books and movies and music are full of this idea. Whether it's Gatsby turning himself from a nobody to a somebody or Drake starting from the bottom, there's something appealing about the idea that anyone can make it if they try hard enough. And more than maybe anywhere else, that idea is embraced in the United States, where the mythos of the land of opportunity is practically part of you're doing worse relative to your peers. Relative mobility is how you move up or down in social position compared to the rest of society. We can measure social mobility quantitatively using measures of economic mobility, like by comparing your income to your parents' income at the same age. Or we can look at mobility using qualitative measures. A common measure used by sociologists is occupational status. If your father worked. Since the 1970s, much of the economic growth and income has been at the top of the income distribution. Meanwhile, family incomes have been pretty flat for the rest of the population. This unequal growth in incomes has meant less absolute mobility for Americans. A recent analysis of tax data by a group of economists and sociologists found that absolute mobility has declined over the last half century. While 90% of children born in the 1940s earn more than their parents as adults, only more likely to move out of the middle class than white Americans. Let's go to the Thought Bubble to take a look at research on race and social mobility in action. In 1982, American sociologist Carl Alexander and Doris Entweil began following the lives of a random you're born on the social ladder can have far-reaching consequences. And in addition to race, social mobility can also vary by gender. Over the last half century, women as a whole have experienced absolute mobility. 85% of wealth.

One of them inherited their money, acquiring it through the luck that comes with being born to owners of immense amounts of property and wealth. And the other person worked for what they have. They started at the bottom and through years of hard work and clever dealing, they built a business empire. Now, which one would you say deserves their wealth? Sociologically, the interesting thing here isn't your answer, not really. It's the fact that different societies in different times and places have different us to another principle. That stratification is a characteristic of society and not a matter of individual differences. People are obviously all different from each other, so we might assume that stratification is just kind of a natural outcome of those differences, but it's not. We know this because we can see the effects of social stratification on people independent of their personal choices or traits. For example, children of wealthy families are more likely to live longer and be healthier, to attend college and are suddenly downwardly mobile, that's structural mobility. But stratification isn't just a matter of economic forces and job changes, which brings us to another aspect of social stratification. It isn't just about economic and social inequalities. It's also about beliefs. A society's cultural beliefs tell us how to categorize people, and they also define the inequalities of a stratification system as being normal, even fair. But simply, if people didn't believe that system of decreasing importance, it still holds sway in parts of rural India and it has a strong legacy across the country. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The traditional caste system contains four large divisions called varnas, Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Sutra. Together, these varnas encompass hundreds of smaller groups called jattis at the local level. The caste system in its traditional form is ability to own land, and any say whatsoever in the national government. The Jim Crow laws of the American South were another example, as was slavery before that. In contrast with caste systems, class systems are the archetypal open systems. They aren't being used key to social division, the American system has elements of a meritocracy, which is a system in which social mobility is based on personal merit and individual talents. The American dream is that anyone, no matter how poor, can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and become upwardly class-mobile through nothing but hard work and gumption. That American system is certainly more, for instance, we're including three things. Income, education, and occupational prestige. An example of status and consistency is an adjunct professor who's very well educated but earns a low income. There's an inconsistency among these different aspects of their social status. Low income tends to decrease social status, while at the same time,ia, industrial workers, and the rural peasantry. So, like I mentioned before, stratification is universal but variable. If you want to study a society, one of the things that you need to look at is the way that it's stratified and whether and how social mobility occurs. Today we learned about social stratification. We talked about four basic principles of a sociological understanding of stratification. We discussed open and closed system with stratification. And finally, we talked about examples of different kinds of stratification.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Religion might not seem like something a sociologist can study. After all, religion is about personal beliefs, right? So, sociology won't give you any answers about the existence of God or how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. But sociology can help you think about religion as a social institution. In the same way that we might study the family or the government, we can ask questions about religion's role in society. Like, how do different religions influence about seeing a certain place, object, or experience as special, and creating markers that separate it from your day-to-day life. It's natural then to think about religion from the perspective of symbolic interactionism, which thinks about society in terms of the symbols that humans construct, of society. First, religion helps establish social cohesion by uniting people around shared symbols, norms, and values. Durkheim argued that religious thought promotes norms like morality, fairness, charity, and justice. Church's act is gathering places, forming the backbone of social life for many people. But while Durkheim's framing demonstrates the many ways religions promote social unity, religion can, of course, also be a force of division. Social conflict theory perspectives understand religion in terms of how it entrenches existing inequalities. Karl Marx saw religion as an agent of social stratification, which served those in power by legitimizing the status quo and framing existing inequality as part of a divine any major museum in the Western world, you're pretty much guaranteed to find some art depicting religious figures from Judaism or Christianity. And in these paintings, God is pretty much exclusively an old white man with a beard. And in fact, divine figures and their profits in most religions are male. Virtually all of the side of oppression. Quakers, a sect of Christianity, or leaders in the abolition movement, and in the women's suffrage movement of the 19th century. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was led by many with ties to the Black religious community, most notably the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a civil rights organization headed up by a depends a lot on who you are, in terms of where you live, in terms of class, and in terms of race and ethnicity. More well-established religious faiths that are well integrated into society are what sociologists call churches. Most major religions are what we would call a church. For example, Christianity, Islam, faith, with evangelical churches being the most common affiliation. There's also a growing number of black Americans who identify as Muslim, with about 40% of all native-born Muslims in the US identifying themselves as African-Americans. Overall, however, the importance of religion in the United States has been on the decline in recent decades, a process known as secularization. Younger Americans are much more likely now to report that they do not believe in any religion compared to past generations.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Two bachelor's degrees, PhD from Harvard University, two-year fellowship to study in Berlin, professor of sociology and history at two different universities, author of countless books, activist and co-founder of a key civil rights organization, editor and co-founder of a magazine, and a poet to boot. Pretty good resume, yeah? What if I make it a bit more impressive? That PhD from Harvard, first Harvard PhD granted to an African-American. The, now know that this was not just wrong, but deeply harmful. And more than that, the idea that race itself is a purely biological immutable quality is also understood today as being simply untrue. Instead, race is thought of as a socially constructed category of people who share biological traits that society has deemed important. Yes, human beings vary a thread in much of Du Bois' work, the idea of double consciousness. Du Bois argued that there are two competing identities as a black American, seeing oneself residents. For example, the black population turned out to be much younger than the white population and had a higher proportion of women. It also had lower literacy rates, higher rates of poverty and crime, and a higher concentration of workers in the service industry than in manufacturing or trade. Mortality rates were into their union. The prevailing beliefs about race and racism ultimately reinforce themselves. This is what's now known as racial formation theory, a theory formalized by modern sociologist Michael Omi and Howard Wannand. Racial formation refers to the process through which social, political, and economic forces influence how a society defines racial categories, and how those racial categories, in turn, end up shaping those Crisis. The NAACP fought against lynching, segregation of schools, voting disenfranchisement, and much more. It used journalism as one of its most powerful tools, publishing the records of thousands of lynchings over a 30-year period, and it used lawsuits targeting voter disenfranchisement and school segregation in decade-long court battles. And after Du Bois' time, it went on to become part of many of the landmark moments in the fight for civil rights, including the Brown vs higher incomes, banking services, and housing. These ideas about how the structures of power interact with race may have their origins and devoices work, but they continue today. And so do the studies of racial resistance. Researchers of racial resistance ask, how do different racial groups challenge and change the structures of power? Sometimes African Americans in Philadelphia to look at how economic, political, and social structures affect how we perceive different races, and vice versa. And finally, we looked at the activist side of Du Bois' life as co-founder of the NAACP and editor of The Crisis and discussed how modern day sociologists study racial politics and racial resistance.

You go back to daydreaming, teacher goes back to teaching, and everyone's happy. A lot of stuff just happened there. Stuff that raises many questions Now, this still doesn't tell us why these relationships work the way they do, but it does tell us where to look. If our interactions are a matter of hand, is an achieved status. It's earned, accomplished, or obtained with at least some effort on the person's part. Professions then are achieved statuses, so as being a student or a parent. Beyond this difference, there's also the fact that some statuses are more important than others. A master status is the status others, then roles are the sets of behaviors, obligations, and privileges that go with that status. So a person holds a status, but they perform a role. Keep that word in mind. Perform. Now, since a person can have multiple statuses, they can have multiple roles, too. But a single status often has multiple roles that go with it. For example, a teacher's role in the classroom is to teach and lead students. But in the faculty lounge, the status of teacher has another a certain role in a process called role exit. This can be voluntary, like quitting your job, or involuntary, like getting dumb. In either case, it's rarely as simple as just walking out the door, because roles are a part of who we are. So exiting a role can be traumatic, especially without preparation or if the exit isn't by choice. Now, we you have the status of a teacher, people expect, even demand, that you do the things that teachers are expected to do. How you feel about your status doesn't really enter into it. And we know who the teacher and who's a student based on our background assumptions, our experiences, and the socialization that teaches us about norms in various situations., that is, to satisfy the audience. In order to do this, people need to carefully control the information others receive about them in a process called impression management.

If there are no cars coming, do you stay at the crosswalk waiting for the light to change? Or do you just go for it? Do you look left first before you cross? Or do you look right? Or maybe you just dart across the street shouting, hey, I'm walking here! No matter what you do in this situation, it's going to depend on culture. Now, you may be thinking, how can something like crossing the street is non-material, too. We interpret the color red to mean stop because our culture has assigned red as a symbol for stop and green for go. And if you grew up in a country where cars drive on the right side of the road, your parents probably taught you to look left first before crossing. This is non-material culture, the culture of ideas. language, it just seems like bad grammar. Whether it's written, spoken, or nonverbal, language allows us to share the things that make up our culture, a process known as cultural transmission. And one view of language is that it not only lets us communicate with each other, but that it also affects how people within a culture see the world around them. This theory, known as the Sapier-Werf hypothesis, argues that a person divided on. Benjamin Lee Wharf, the American linguist who helped shape this theory, did his original research on indigenous languages like Hopi and Inuit, and since then, anthropologists have argued that some of his findings don't hold up. For example, Wharf famously claimed that because the Hopi language describes time differently, the Hopi people think of time differently. But anthropological evidence about the Hopi people suggests otherwise, and Wharf's study led to a strange and false stereotype that the Hopi their parents and more likely to see multi-generational households in China. Cultural values and beliefs can also help form the guidelines for behavior within that culture. These guidelines are what we call norms or the rules and expectations that guide behavior within a society. So giving up your seat for an elderly person? Great! Picking your nose in public? Gross! These are two ways of talking about norms. A norm simply relates to what we think is normal, whether something is either culturally? Probably not. No shirt? You're fired. But mores aren't universal. You may get fired for showing up at work without a shirt, but men can lay on the beach shirtless or walk down the street with no problem. For women, these norms are different. In the United States, cultural norms about women's bodies and sexuality mean that it's illegal for women to go talk less in public. But then, in parts of Europe, social norms are more lax about nudity, and it's not uncommon for women to also be. But not all norms have clearly defined moral distinctions, like the way a culture's emphasis on competition pushes people toward success, but also discourages cooperation. And that's the tricky thing about culture. Most of the time you don't notice the cultural forces that are shaping your thoughts and actions, because they just seem normal. That's why sociologists study culture. We can't notice whether our values and our norms are good or bad unless we step back and look at them with the analytical eye of a sociology.\", 'Sociology'], [\" The healthcare system in America is complicated. Doctors, hospitals, insurance, and drug companies. It can be hard to navigate all the moving parts of healthcare, and it's even harder if you're trying to do it when you're sick. Theory and statistics can give us a broad understanding of the social and cultural forces that affect health. But for the average American, making choices about healthcare, the questions that matter most are the practical ones. After all, when you're running a fever, the most important question is, where can you find a certain poverty threshold. The government also provides healthcare through things like VA hospitals, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and it has a legal mandate to provide healthcare for people in federal prison. But the voluntary sector is different in that it includes charitable organizations that do health research and provide free or low-cost health services, like the American Cancer Association or the March of Dimes. So with all of these options available, what determines how easy or hard it might be to get access to healthcare? In this context appointments. Transportation to appointments can be much more difficult in rural places where providers tend to be farther away. This is especially hard for people with chronic illnesses or disabilities that make it impossible for them to drive by themselves. Time can also be a limiting factor. Doctors appointments are usually during business hours, so patients may have to miss work to get the care they need. Low income and blue collar workers are more likely gives them the information they need to make decisions themselves, but others just want to leave all the decision-making to the doctor and just be told what pills to take. How satisfied a patient is with their healthcare tends to depend on the match between their preferences and their doctor-style of care, or the doctor-patient congruence. A patient's satisfaction with incentivizes over-treatment and this drives up the cost of care. The US also relies on a third-party payer system, which means that medical costs are paid through a third party, like a commercial insurance company that's responsible for paying the doctor on behalf of the patient that you won't have to empty your bank account if you fall out of a tree. This is a simple example of a risk pool, a group of individuals who are covered under one insurance plan. An insurance company decides how to set their premiums and deductibles based on how likely the risk is that they'll resulting in the worst continuity of care. As a result, being uninsured is associated with a greater need for more expensive and more urgent medical procedures. The high costs of medical care in the U.S. and the high number of uninsured people are big parts of what spurred the passage of the Affordable Care Act and kicked off the national debate about the best way to deal with these twin problems in the U.S. health system. Of course, what we've covered here today is only one understanding of how healthcare works in the U.S.\", 'Sociology'], [\" How does a family become a family?

It might seem strange to think of dating as a part of family formation. After all, when you're swiping right on Tinder, you're probably not thinking about adding that person to your family. But families are a dynamic social institution, changing over the course of your life. What the word family conjures in your mind is going to be very cute. It's courtship. I'm sure you know what courtship means, but in case it's on your final, it's the period of developing a relationship with an eye toward marriage or long-term partnership. So how do people pair off in different societies? Well, some cultures, including the US, put a heavy emphasis on romantic love as the foundation of a partnership. Finding the one are just around, because we often live near people like ourselves. Now, of course, courtship doesn't always lead to marriage. In fact, in recent years, marriageidelity that may not surprise you is divorce. You might have heard that half of all marriages end in divorce, but that's not quite accurate. For one thing, it's not that every couple has a 50-50 chance of divorce. The 50% stat comes from looking at the likelihood that marriages become much more stable than they were in previous decades. Plus, the type of people who get married and their likelihood of divorce has changed too. Divorce rates are higher for low income and less educated Americans, who are also the socioeconomic group with the greatest declines in marriage rates in the last 40 years. So, declined and the US industrialized, the average family size declined from seven children in 1800 to 3.5 children by 1900. Nowadays, birth rates are even lower.

This post-children's stage of family life, with 66% of black children being raised in a single parent home compared to only 25% of non-Hispanic white children. Some of these kids are still growing up in households with two parents, though. 58% of unmarried births were to cohabiting couples or couples who lived together without being married. Unmarried or divorced parents may also marry someone new, creating a blended family with one parent in a household who is unrelated to some or all of the children.

Every second you're sitting there surfing the internet, you're getting one second older. But it's also true in a global sense. The average age of humanity is going up, and going up pretty rapidly, especially in North America, Europe, and many parts of Asia. A report from the United Nations shows that the median age of the world population has risen from 23 in 1950 to 30 as of 2015. And by 2050, the median age for the entire world will be 36. In more developed, a country starts with really high birth rates and really high death rates, resulting in a population with a lot of very young people, but not much overall population growth. Then, agricultural and technological advances improve the standards of living, access to food, water, housing, and medical treatment all improve, which reduces the number of people who are dying at a young age. People are still having a lot of children, but they, and diabetes. 78% of Americans age 55 and older have at least one chronic condition. As infectious diseases like smallpox or tuberculosis become a thing of the past and high-income countries, chronic diseases have become the leading cause of death in those countries. That said, it's not like everyone, also known as aging clock theories, focus on how the body switches on or off certain biological processes as you reach a certain age. For example, the immune system is at its peak during puberty and slowly declines as you age, meaning that it's harder for your body to fight off new diseases when you're older. Along with the biological changes that people experience as they burden in the former than the latter.

A gerontocracy is a form of social organization in which the oldest members of society have the most wealth, power, and prestige. As nations industrialize, however, the main source of income shifts from land ownership to income from work. And many older people move out of paid labor, whether it's by choice or because it's a difficult transition for both financial and cultural reasons. While many wealthier countries provide some kind of income support for the elderly, like Social Security in the US, retirement is generally only feasible for those who save enough during their working years to live comfortably after they've stopped working. In economic downturns like the Great Recession, the value of people's retirement savings will often plummet, forcing people to work further into old age than they age. Death is a bit of a grim note to end our discussion of aging on, but just as aging plays a specific cultural role, so does death. And as the saying goes, nothing is certain in life except death in taxes. Observing how death plays and navigating medical decisions as they near the end of life.

I mean, who decided that teenagers need to get to school at the ungodly hour of 7 a.m.? That right there seems like a big drawback that we didn't consider when we talked about the positive functions of schools. Last week, we discussed all the good things about schooling. How it helps people learn about the world, how it helps kids meet other kids their own age, and how there are countless other ways that it helps society function better. But there are many not-so-good components of's talents consistently. Grades don't just measure an individual student's effort or ability. They're also influenced by many factors outside of the student's control, like the quality of their school or their access to resources, like books or computers. This is where social conflict theory comes into the story funding for a school allows schools to hire better teachers, buy more and better supplies, offer a wider variety of classes, and provide extracurricular activities. And these differences in school quality translate to differences in outcomes for students. We know this because of research, like a recent study done by American economist Kerab whose parents have the time, money, and knowledge to support education in the home will have a step up on students whose parents don't have the time or resources to pass on cultural capital. For example, higher-income parents are more likely to read to their kids and spend schools. And the US education system doesn't just contribute to class gaps in educational achievement. We also see persistent achievement gaps by race in the US, and they're made worse by elements of our education system that advantage white students. We've talked before about the role that historical patterns of segregation have played in shaping the neighborhoods that minority kids grow up in. For White and Asian students are more likely to be chosen to be in honors or AP classes than Black and Hispanic students, which then contributes to racial gaps in college attendance. Who gets chosen for college prep classes and who's put in vocational classes? Often has to do with not just academic ability, but teachers' perception of a student's behavior. Let's go to the Thought Bubble to talk about how classroom discipline has especially negative implications for minority students. In the school-to-prison pipeline. This is an informal tracking for students that criminalizes deviant behavior in schools, even minor disciplinary issues, like talking back to teachers. For minority students, schools are more likely to escalate disciplinary issues to the juvenile justice system, putting students in contact with the criminal justice system at an type of tracking is more common for minority students, which can contribute to racial gaps in educational achievement. More broadly, tracking can have long-term consequences for what kinds of opportunities are available to students or the choices that they make later in life.

If you had to describe why you think you're a member of one race and someone else was a member of a different one, you'd probably focus on appearances. Your skin, your hair, maybe even the structures of your bodies and faces. But most of the time, those physical criteria mean different things depending on the culture you're a part of. An obvious example is skin color. We use the words white and black to describe two races, but the distinction in skin color between those races isn't as clear-cut. A different race than people with brown eyes. And while physical traits are often used to describe or identify a race, they're not always applied consistently. Take, for example, the so-called one-drop rule in the United States, where even the smallest amount of African-American ancestry is enough to classify someone as black rather than white. The opposite, however, isn't true. Someone with one black parent and one white parent is almost never considered white. Plus, people people of the same race might be of totally different ethnicities. Japanese and Vietnamese people are both considered Asian, but they come from different cultural backgrounds. In fact, a term that many people think refers to race, Hispanic, actually refers to ethnicity. To explore this a little more, let's go to the Thought Bubble to talk about the difference between the terms Hispanic, Latino, and Latin American. The term Hispanic first appeared as a racial category in, ethnicities aren't, and in fact, two people of the same ethnicity can be entirely different races. For example, both Cameron Diaz and Rosario Dawson are Cuban Americans, which means they are both Hispanic, but Cameron Diaz is white and Rosario Dawson is black. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Though race is more commonly used by society as a way to in society and have less access to the levers of societal power. Notice how that definition doesn't say anything about the size of the group. In sociology, a minority group's relative size isn't important. For example, women are considered a minority even though they make up races that make up the United States. The US Census uses six different categories of race when collecting data about the demographics of the country. White refers to anyone who reports their origins as being from Europe, the Middle East, or Northern Africa. So Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Iranian, Moroccan, they're all ethnicities that go under the heading of white. Black or African Americans are the second largest racial group in the United States and are defined as individuals with African heritage, including those who are Afro-Caribbean. Since many African Americans' ancestors were forcibly brought to the United States as slaves, the countries that their ancestors originated from are often unknown. To this day, the remnants of slavery and the southern plantation systems can be seen in the geographic distribution of Black Americans around the country. Though many Black before, Hawaii is one of the states where a minority race is the majority race for the state, and in fact, it's the only state that has always been minority majority. The last census category is just to catch all some other race. You might remember that about a third of Hispanic Americans fall into this group. If a person lists a country of origin that doesn't fit in one of the other categories, they get stuck in this group. You might be thinking that these categories don't seem like the racial groups you typically think of. And that's okay. In all likelihood, the way that the government defines races will continue\", 'Sociology'], [\" Hello, I am Not Hank. I am Nicole, and I'm usually a behind-the-scenes member of the Crash Course staff, but for the next year, I will be here teaching you about sociology. We've covered a lot of things here at Crash Course, and sociology has kind of been lurking throughout all of them. Sociology is the study of people and society, and that includes a really broad range of topics, everything from social and economic inequalities, to marriage and family formation, to political and religious institutions. Sociologists answer questions like, what is class, and why does almost every American seem to think that they're middle class?\", 'Sociology'], [\" A social institution that has one of the biggest impacts on society is the economy. And you might think of the economy in terms of numbers. Unemployment numbers, GDPs, or whatever the stock market is doing today. But while we often talk about it in numerical terms, the economy is really made of people. It's the social institution that organizes all production, consumption, and trade of goods in a society. And there are lots of different ways in which stuff can be made, exchanged, and used. Think capitalism or socialism. These economic systems and the economic revolutions that created them shaped the way things used to be for much of human history. So how did we get from a world where people worked to produce just what they needed for their families to one with all these sectors that have to work together? To understand that, we need to back up a little. About 12,000 years. The first big economic change was the agrarian revolution. When people first learned how to domesticate plants and animals, it ushered in a new agricultural economy that was much more productive than hunter-gatherer societies were. So in the late 19th century, labor unions began to form. These organizations of workers sought to improve wages and working conditions through collective action, strikes, and negotiations. Inspired by Marxist principles, labor unions are partly to think for us now having things like minimum wage laws, reasonable working hours, and regulations to protect the safety of workers. Thanks Thought Bubble an economy doesn't work very well if it's left completely on autopilot. There are lots of sectors where a hands-off approach can lead to what economists call market failures, where an unregulated market ends up allocating goods and services inefficiently. A monopoly, for example, is a kind of market failure. When a company has no competition for customers, it can charge higher prices without worrying about losing customers. That, as economic allocations go, is really inefficient, at least on the consumer end. So stepping stone toward communism, a political and economic system in which all members of a society are socially equal. But of course, in practice, this hasn't played out in the countries that have modeled their economies on socialism, like Cuba, North Korea, China, and the former USSR. Why? Well, Marx hoped that as story, because we're living in the middle of the economic revolution that followed the Industrial Revolution. Ours is the time of the Information Revolution. Technology has reduced the role of human labor and shifted it from a manufacturing-based economy to one based on service work and made this Crash Course video for you. Now, that's a really big and diverse group. That's because the tertiary sector, like all the economic sectors we've been discussing, is defined mainly by what it produces, rather than what kinds of jobs it includes. So, sociologists have a way of distinguishing between types of jobs based more on the social status and compensation that come can be broken down into the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. We discussed the three stages of economic revolution that brought us to the modern post-industrial era, and in the middle there we talked about two types of economic models, capitalism and socialism.

So do an American vegan preparing a meal at home and a white collar criminal committing tax fraud and a runaway slave. They're all social deviants. We've spent a lot of time so far talking about how society fits together and how it functions, but we can't cover that in any meaningful way without also talking about the people who don't not considered deviant. Dying your hair bright purple? That is deviant, and might earn you some strange looks from some people. And strange looks from strangers are a form of social control. Attempts by society to regulate people's thoughts and behaviors in ways that limit or punish deviants. Specifically, the strange looks are what are known as negative sanctions, negative social reactions to deviants. The opposite, naturally, are at scientific explanations for deviance and crime in particular are biologically essentialist explanations. They were based on the idea that something about a person's essential biology made them deviant. In 1876, Cesare Lombrozo, an Italian physician, theorized that criminals were basically subhuman, throwbacks to a more primitive version of humanity. He went so far as to suggest that deviance could be singled out based on physical characteristics, like a low forehead, stocky build, and some eventually grow up and engage in aggressive criminal behaviors. Psychological approaches, by contrast, place almost all the explanatory power in a person's environment. While some elements of personality may be inherited, psychologists generally see personality as a matter of socialization, explanations only understand deviance as a matter of abnormality. Both approaches begin by looking for physical or mental irregularities, whereas more recent researchiant because they're labeled as deviant. What I mean here is that it's society's response that defines us or our actions as deviant. The same action can be deviant or not, depending on the context. Sleeping an attendant in a public place can be illegal or it can be a fun weekend activity, depending on where you do it. And as the gluex argued, labeling people can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When society treats you'll need to wait until next week when we look at the major theoretical explanations for crime and deviance. Today we learned about social deviance. We discussed biological and psychological approaches to explaining deviance, what they can bring to the table, and their inherent limitations. Then we finish by turning to the sociological perspective and talking about the social foundations of deviance. Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C.

And there were somewhere between 1 and 10 million people on the entire planet back then. Today, we have football stadiums that can fit 100 people a thousand times over. The city of Shanghai has a population of over 24 million, and there are almost 7.5 billion people on Earth. How the heck did we get from there to here to include all of these things. And conveniently enough, we have one. A society is simply a group of people who share a culture and a territory. That's a good definition, but it doesn't really tell us much about the different kinds of societies, or how we get from one kind to another. For that, we turn to the work of American sociologist Gerhard Lensky. Lensky focused on technology as the main source of societal change, through a process he called socio and gathering societies. Up until about 12,000 years ago, when the domestication of plants and animals led to new kinds of society. Horticultural and pastoral societies. Pastoral societies are based around the domestication of animals and Nobles? Feudalism was an agrarian society. And you know what else happened when societies reached this point? The family starts to become less important. In other kinds of societies, things like education are handled almost entirely by the family. But as societies grow and become more complex, those functions start to be taken up by larger social institutions like the church or schools. And now we finally start approaching present-day America with family roles. Industrial societies were the first to have universal public education, for instance, and for the first time, the majority of healthcare and caregiving were institutionalized, done outside the home in hospitals. The need to keep production organized also meant an increasingly urbanized population, because it's easier to control the resources all of these changes are beneficial. Pollution, global warming, and large-scale warfare are new problems that technology has brought us. And technology doesn't solve fundamental societal problems. It has the potential to reorganize society, but technology can't tell us how to have peaceful or just societies. In fact, just looking at Lensky's and inequality are leveled by the lack of surplus and the need to share resources. But that's not the case in post-industrial society. Max Weber, for his part, seems further away from Lonsky than Marx, focusing not on technology or revolution, but on ideasependence organic solidarity. And so Lensky's sociocultural evolution is, for Durkheim, the story of a long transition from mechanical to organic solidarity. Ultimately, all of these ways of looking at society and its changes from the point of view of technology, or conflict and revolution, or ideas, or underlying social structure,\", 'Sociology'], [\" You're a good citizen, right? You voted in the last election, or you're looking forward to voting in the future, you pay your taxes, you're happy to exercise the full range of your civic responsibilities. The point is, you might already know all about how your government works. If you don't, and you're American, well, there's a crash course for that. But even if you're an informed out these decisions because it has a lot of power, which our old friend Max Weber defined as the ability to achieve desired ends over the objections of others. Now, Weber considered a government's power to be coercive power, or power that's backed by the threat of force. You is the power behind the US Constitution, whose written rules determine the entire American political and legal system. When the Constitution is changed or reinterpreted, the rules change, as with when the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was legal in 2015, for example. Finally, we have a kind of, monarchy is a political system in which power is legitimized by traditional authority and held by a single family. This is maybe most obvious in the feudal European idea of the divine right of kings, in which in the reverence with which the Constitution and the Founding Fathers are invoked in political discourse. Now, the US as an example can move us from what has so far been a pretty theoretical discussion of authority in politics to seeing how sociology can help us understand what they look like in practice. To understand power, authority On social issues, one way of understanding the gap between left and right is in terms of the different kinds of authority that each faction tends to support or endorse. Here, the right tends to build its arguments on traditional authority, while the left tends to look to legal rational frameworks. We can see this in the issue of marriage equality, for example. The right has often described its opposition as a defense of traditional marriage, while the left has argued that marriage equality was an extension of legal civil rights. Now, no matter where your political theory and dominated much of American sociology in the 1950s and early 60s. In this line of thinking, demonstrations are seen as irrational outbursts, pointless gestures and a political system that already distributes political power fairly. However, in the power elite model, political protests make perfect sense. This view Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C.

But we haven't really discussed how you lump all those little things together and say, yes, these are the things that belong together. These things are culture A and these other things are culture B. So what are the rules of culture? Well, culture also known as popular culture, which is exactly what it sounds like. Low or popular culture includes the cultural behaviors and ideas that are popular with most people in a society. High culture, meanwhile, refers to cultural patterns that distinguish a society's elite. You can sort of think of low culture the material culture that signifies membership in your own specific subculture. But who decides what's mainstream and what's a subculture? I mean, the whole hipster thing has gone pretty mainstream at this point. Typically, cultural groups with the most power and societal influence get labeled the norm, and people with less power get relegated to subgroups. The US is a great example of this. In large part because of our For example, Afro-centrism is a school of thought that re-centers historical and sociological study on the contributions of Africans and African Americans.

Instead of looking at behavior through the lens of your own culture, you can look at it through the lens of multiculturalism, a perspective that, rather The 1960s.

When European explorers first discovered tomatoes in Central America in the smaller. As our society becomes more global, the questions raised by two of our camps of sociology, structural functionalism and conflict theory become even more pressing. Are the structural functionalists right? Does having a shared culture provide points of similarity that encourage cooperation and help society's function? Or does conflict theory have it right? Does culture divide us and benefit some members of society more than others? In the end, they're both kind of right.

Now what messenger RNA is basically just that it's the messenger. So again, whenever your cell, and here's a cell right here, decides that it needs a So again, they aren't made from the mRNA, which is this. The mRNA is not an ingredient of the protein. The ribosome is not an ingredient of the protein because remember, proteins are made from amino acids. together, linked together in form of protein, but for right now, just knowing that the ribosomes then organize mRNA and other molecules needed to build the proteins.

Now cellular respiration of course is a pretty complex process but it can be broken up into three main steps. The first step is called glycolysis. Now glycolysis is pretty much a process where cells to two phosphates. So therefore you lose a phosphate but it doesn't just disappear in the thin ear. Thin ears, no, thin air. It gets added on to your glucose molecule right here. So now the glucose and phosphate is almost ready to give off energy and glucose plus phosphate, this molecule is technically called glucose 6-phosphate. So whenever you have a glucose with a phosphate group added on, the molecule that we have right now is called glucose 6-phosphate. is that Fruco 6-phosphate, this molecule right here, it has the exact same molecular formula as glucose 6-phosphate. Now the reason that they aren't the same name is because the atoms course whenever we use ATP, it goes to ADP and it loses a phosphate. So what happens in this process is Fruco 6 Phosphate with another phosphate added on. But technically, you know, that's not what it's called. But the important concepts to take away here is that notice so far what we're doing is we're trying to create energy here. Our cell needs energy. But right now in the very first step, we needed to use an ATP. So we needed to use energy. And then on step number three, we needed to use another energy.

I'm going to be basically drawing a diagram that's a zoomed up portion of this. Remember, these proteins and molecules I'm going to be drawing are actually embedded right on or in the inner membrane.

A leo say from the mom in a short one from the dad Well that plant would be tall and why is that? Well unlike the blending theory where you know people thought it would be average Mendo.

But basically, one of these chromatids are going to go to one cell, and one of them are going to go other cell and even though the splits in half each daughter cell is going to be identical why is that?

Now why does it do that? Well, your body can't really use that or your cells can't really use that in any real, you know, particular kind of way. So what they need to do is they need to break it for the carbon molecules that are inside. But basically what your body starts to do whenever it breaks all those complex carbohydrates up into glucose is that it uses it for energy. But of course your body just doesn't, I don't know, it's not like putting a bunch of fuel on a fire and to need some energy here. What it does is it breaks down this glycogen into individual glucose molecules and that way it could break it up and use the glucose as energy.

Now CITO Kinesis is the actual process of your cell, splitting in two, informing two brand new individual daughter cells. Now this is actually the last part of how cytokinesis occurs in animals is pretty self-explanatory. The important things we need to take away is that the cleavage furrow is the area where, you know, the indentation is going to form things to the proteins. And what the proteins are going to do is they're going to act like So if the proteins were to come in and try to squeeze it together, it couldn't because it's so rigid. So what needs to happen instead is actually, let me draw a little arrow again. So I know it's a different, you know, time has passed. What's going to happen? And I guess I got to draw my two little nuclei, of course, now have vesicles that are going to come in and dump new cell wall material splitting the original cell into two daughter cells. And the reason is that we need the vesicles to dump the new cell wall material into the new cell is because the cell wall right here is so rigid, we just can't squeeze it together like animal cells.\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? Welcome to your fourth biology video and in this video I want to start off by talking to you guys about chemistry Why do I want to talk to you guys about chemistry if this is a biology video? Well, if you think about it biology kind of is chemistry Hmm, what the heck do I mean by that? Well, think about it take you for example ionic and covalent bonds. So if you know these very basic things, you're ready to move on with these biology tutorials. But if you don't understand compound is a molecule that contains two or more different elements. Now the reason that I wanted acid is because it releases a positively charged hydrogen ion right there and that is the requirements for an acid. Now the opposite of an acid is called a base. So let's go ahead and talk about bases. B-A-S-E-S in case you know maybe you can't read my handwriting. But a base is a molecule that splits apart in a release and hydroxide anion. So basically why is this a base? Well the requirement for a base is whenever you add it to water it releases a hydroxide and hydroxide is OH negative that's the chemical formula. Now you know that's nice and all but this kind of looks like chemistry and we were talking about biology. So why the heck is any of this important and why do I even need to know it? Well\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? Welcome to your seventh biology tutorial and in this video I want to talk to you guys about carbohydrates, but before I get into that I want to go ahead and mention a few things about carbon because believe it or not they kind of tie in together really closely and I guess before Haven start talking about the educational stuff. I just want to say I apologize if I sound kind of nasally right now, but Well, you actually get carbon from food. There's a bunch of carbon in food and whenever you eat it, your body breaks apart, uses the carbon for, you know, turns into a bunch of different stuff. Plants, however, they don't eat food, they make their own food, but we'll talk about more of those differences later on for now. Just remember that your body loves carbon and it turns carbon into different things that your is basically all the same thing. So now that we know what carbohydrates kind of you know the chemical formula at least you're wondering why the heck does your body even need carbohydrates because you know what Bucky I read the Atkins diet and he said that carbohydrates are bad and make you fat. Well that is true if you have a ton of carbohydrates in your body but your body 1 oxygen. However, this right here is actually a special carbohydrate called glucose. It's actually a sugar and sugars are carbohydrates, believe it or not. Fun fact, I'm going to be talking about that later. But for right now, you know, I just wanted to give you guys that little random bit of information because this was bugging me right down there. For this tutorial, all you have to remember is that the formula for carbohydrate is typically with a ratio 1\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 44th biology video and in this video I want to talk to you guys about DNA replication But before we get into that I need to discuss cell division Now cell division is basically just what it sounds like it's when you have one cell and it divides Into two and you know the process is a little more complicated than that But that you just have a cut on your knee or wherever on your body. New cells are needed to repair your body. So like broken bones and cuts, that's another reason why your cells need to divide. And the last reason is of course reproduction. We got to keep the species going. That's why we need more cells. Now when a cell reproduces, what it does is actually a What this enzyme does is it basically reads the DNA code on each strand, the left strand, and the right strand. It builds a new partner strand, complementary to the original strand. Now another thing I want to mention before I go any further is that I know I didn't talk to you guys about the different type of nucleotides, but remember that I said the go ahead and give me an example. So if one of the strands was like A, C, T, A, G, let's go ahead and remember our rules right here. Here are the rules right here. And the rules are A always gets paired with T and C always gets paired with G. So this would be, can you guess it? A, A, T, C.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 13th biology tutorial and in this tutorial now that we understand the basics of what DNA molecule is made up of and we understand what nucleic acid is what I want to do is I want to take a closer look at this silly little thing called DNA now like I said in the last video DNA is probably the most famous nucleic acid. Just because we know amino acids are the so-called building blocks of proteins. That's what proteins are made up of. But I just said genes are the blueprint for proteins. However, if we're building a house, we know that a house is built of bricks and it has a blueprint blueprint tells the amino\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys welcome to your 39th video and in this video what I want to do is now that you understand the nitty gritty details of the Krebs cycle I want to go in the other direction and give you guys a very broad Simple summary of the entire Krebs cycle how each step is pieced together and hopefully what this would do is it'll clear up any confusion that you have on the little pieces and it'll also help you visualize exactly what's going on So remember that by the end of the Krebs for an NADH. And also, the next thing is it lost the CO2 and it combined with co-enzyme A, so COA. And whenever this happened, it was no longer called pyruvate, it was called acetyl-CoA. So this was the molecule that we said that was allowed to enter the Krebs cycle. So this is the carbon and actually formed and I guess I'll make NADH with my little cloud around it. By the way, this isn't like the standard symbol for NADH. I just thought it would be cool. So this is the only ATP that's formed in the Krebs cycle. However, since two molecules we get from glucose, we get two ATPs in total. So now moving on to the sixth step, remember in the sixth stepH was formed and crap, forgot, sorry, new color. NADH was formed, get you around my little cloud, and if you guys are counting my clouds, this was one, two, three, four, this was your fourth NADH, and of course multiply that by two, gives you your eight NADHs, and, oh, color, what's I rewriting in white?\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 36 biology video and in this video I want to start talking to you guys about the Krebs cycle. Now in the last video what I did is I showed you guys how Peruvic Acid, which was the ending molecule we had after glycosis becomes acetyl CoA because we need the molecule acetyl CoA to enter the Krebs cycle. And if you don't know how you know Peruvic Acid becomes acetyl CoA, please watch the last video. Now the reason that I didna. And what this does is it combines with a 4 carbon molecule. So I'll just start for carbon molecule and the 4 carbon molecule is called, let me spell it first. OXAOO acetate. Oxalo acetate and of course whenever, and let me go ahead and draw this molecule. See? So of course this is a six carbon molecule like we said. And again, there are other things that are going to be bonded onto this, but I'm only going to draw the, you see how this oxygen or this hydroxyl group is in the middle right here. This is actually going to go to your 4th carbon so that OH goes down here and your hydrogen goes up here. So basically this and this change place. So just to recap one last time, that's all step number two is a molecule becomes an isomer of itself or in other words, it's molecules get rear\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 16th biology tutorial and in this tutorial I want to take a closer look at the plasma membrane specifically the different parts that make it up and the first part I want to start with is called the phospholipids so phospholipids now we remember that we talked about phospholipids before and they're wondering okay, so does it just happen by chance that they're randomly, you know, all their heads are stuck together and all of their tails are stuck together or pointing in the same direction and it doesn't happen by chance because in fact the heads of these are attracted to water and a protein right there. Now again, as you can see the proteins are kind of embedded in the phospholipid bilayers and they aren't just stuck there. They actually float around your entire cell membrane but for right now it's easier to draw if I just draw it embedded like that. So the next part I guess we want to talk about is actually it'll probably be easier if I draw some more views because that's kind of what they look like. cholesterol. They do serve a purpose other than to look good and their purpose is to identify the blood or identify the cell and we'll talk more about that later on but just remember right now that you do have a carbohydrate chains and a fun fact is that your blood type you know how you have ABO they actually depend on which type of carbohydrate chains are bonded to the membrane. Pretty cool but just worry about that later on. So for now of course the main part\", 'Biology'], [\" Ladies and gentlemen welcome to your 11th biology tutorial and in this video we're gonna be talking about Proteins good enough I really need to take a class in handwriting but nonetheless we're gonna be talking about proteins and let's go ahead and start off by talking about why do you even need proteins in your body and that's actually proteins are one of the most diverse strung together, they can form something called a polypeptide chain. So, polypeptide chain. So that's what we have right here in a fun little fact, is that these amino acids are actually linked together by the process of dehydration synthesis, and we about some of the most common ones right now because again, like I said, proteins do a crap load of different stuff and it's going to take me forever if I try to explain each one. But one of the Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body and also hemoglobin is another famous one I guess you probably hear that a lot and its job is pretty much to take oxygen in deliver it to different places on your body.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 50 second biology lesson and in this lesson I want to start talking about Myosis now before I start talking about the individual stages and phases of myosis What I want to do is I want to give you guys a real brief overview of the entire process of myosis and I want to do this because after learning about mitosis Myosis can basically instead of making normal cells, like I said we're making sperm cells and egg cells, and also the resulting cells only have half of the chromosomes as the original parent cell. So again, like I said, that's the main difference between meiosis and mitosis. Now another thingologous chromosomes. So remember I said that every cell in your body with exception of egg cell or sperm cell are deployed or they have two sets of chromosomes. One chromosome from your dad and one chromosome from your mom. Now every chromosome from your dad has a matching one from your mom that is the same size and shape. And whenever they form a pair\", 'Biology'], [\" What is going on guys? Welcome to your 49th biology video and in this video we're finally going to start talking about mitosis which is one of the two ways that cells divide in your body. Now the entire process of mitosis can be split up into a couple main phases and the first phase is of course called prophase. I'll draw that a little bit ne, gets rid of it, or makes it dissolve. Now the last main characteristic of prophase is something called mitotic spindles are going to form. Now think of mitotic spindles as little bugs with arms, and these bugs like to pull on things. So what's going to happen is these mitotic spindles are going to attach to the chromosomes, and eventually\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 29th biology video and in this video I want to talk to you guys a little bit more about the molecule ATP Now I already said in the last couple videos that ATP is a molecule in your body that stores energy But where exactly does this energy your cells want to store energy in a molecule called ATP? Well, the reason for this is because your cells don't really need cheeseburgers. They can'tenosine would be something like this. In Trifosphate, of course, means three phosphates. A Dr. Phosphate would look like this and this and this. So I'll put energy released. Now when the energy is released, your cell can use that to, you know, bond together whatever other molecules, you know, maybe it has a random molecule down here, A, that it wants to bond with this one, B, so it uses the energy from this However, your body can't really use ADP for energy, it needs ATP. So what happens is this ADP, which is two phosphates, it needs another phosphate. So what happens is it heads over to the mitochondria because remember, the mitochondria is the place where it's pretty much what happens. Whenever a cell is like, dude, need energy. So here's my little cell that needs energy right here. What happens is it talks to ATP and ATP is like, all right, I can spare some energy by getting rid of a phosphate. So it does that and then the energy heads over to the cell and the cell uses it for whatever it needs. However, now we have a problem. Now we are left with ADP.\", 'Biology'], [\" So one last time let me go ahead and explain what happens because wow this is this diagram got very confusing very quick Basically, let me go ahead and pick white basically we start with NADH which is an electron carrying molecule It's going to give its electrons to NADH dehydrogenase now as this happens per Electron one hydrogen ion is going to be pumped out to the other side of thease. So now in here, once it has four electrons, what it's going to do is it's going to grab an oxygen from the environment and eight of these hydrogen ions and it's going to combine them all together in a weird recipe and you end up with your final product, which is two water molecules. Now after it's done baking that recipe, it has a could crash them together because it takes energy to combine molecules together. So it's going to take these two molecules and crash them together to form ATP. Now just remember that we don't just have one NADH here. Through the process of cellular respiration we made a law of NADHs. So this NADH is going to make a crap load of ATP\", 'Biology'], [\" What's up guys, welcome to your 17th biology tutorial and in this video I want to talk to you guys about transporting materials through the plasma membrane or cell membrane, whatever you want to call it. So we already know that things need to get across the plasma membrane and that's because first of all cells create things for other parts of the body so obviously when they're created inside the cell they need of work from anything else. So they can pass through the plasma membrane relatively easy without any complex method. However, certain other things like let me go ahead and choose a color and go ahead and choose red. So a larger molecule like food is actually a really large molecule. It can't go ahead channel or an opening that allows larger molecules to pass through. All right, that's one job. Another job, however, is with carrier proteins. Now, carrier proteins are pretty much exactly2, they can pass through really easy so they don't need the help of anything else. However, larger molecules such as food, as we looked at in this example, they need help from proteins and proteins either form channels, right here, or come in the form of carrier proteins which pick up the molecules\", 'Biology'], [\" What is going on guys? My name is Buck your Roberts and welcome to your very first tutorial in Biology. Now in this video series what I want to do is I want to talk to you guys about many different topics concerning biology. For example, I want to talk to you guys about DNA and genetics and cells and bacteria and life and a whole bunch of interesting stuff. But since this is the very first video, I think what we should do in this video is just stick with the very basics and the first thing I want to do is going to give you a different definition of their outlook on life. However, whenever scientists and biologists were first deciding, you know what, what is life? That's the problem that they had. Everyone had their own separate definition of life itself. So what they needed to do before biology was even invented, which is of course the study of life, is scientists called DNA. Now the reason I said if you never heard of cells before don't worry about it right now is because even though the definition of a cell is like the smallest single unit of life I really don't want to get into it any more than that and this is why. Some people go to school for eight years and then they work their entire career towards learning about the human cell. Just the human cell.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your very last tutorial in glycolysis. In this tutorial we're going to be finishing it up going through steps 7 to 10. 10 is of course the last step in glycolysis. And the good thing is these are actually pretty simple steps, unlike you know step number 6 which is pretty confusing. So let's go ahead and start with step 7. And remember, whenever we left off in the last tutorial we which is two phosphates, we end up with ATP. Now remember ATP is what we use for energy in the cell. So this is the very first step where we generate an ATP. So finally, we started making some energy here in step number seven. Took us long enough, but we finally started doing it. So remember that since I'm showing this chemical reaction, we produce one ATP. We create any energy yet. So let's go ahead and go to step nine and see if we can oh three in our final Product up to this point is C3 H3 O3 P1 but remember just to recap one last time that finally get our ATP created. So remember, right now we have the molecule PEP in the formula for this is C3H303P1. And what this enzyme is going to do is it or whenever you release a phosphate group, your hydrogens and oxygen may be bonding a little bit differently. But I didn't want to specify every single bond because that's not really important for the scope of this tutorial. The scope of this tutorial in glycolysis isn't about your hydrogens and oxygens, it's mainly about your carbons and your phosphates. So it's about creating energy, turning ADP and ATP and also those NAD crap that we're going to be talking about later on.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 27th biology video and draw this as something with a unique shape. So this is your enzyme right here. Just go ahead and label it. Now on your enzymes why did I write substrate instead of molecule? Well actually whenever we're talking about enzymes the molecule that fits in or attaches to the active site is what we call the substrate. So let me go ahead and draw step two of this enzyme process which would look something like this. This is the very good example of a chemical reaction But that pretty much is what it does the final product Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry I got some hair in my throat the final product of course would be different because if it's the same thing then it wouldn't be an enzyme at all because it didn't catalyze any chemical reaction but basically that's what happens in any enzyme that ends in ASE usually gives a clue as to what the function is. For example, lipase. This would be an enzyme that breaks up lipids or fats. So ASE gives you a clue that it's an enzyme that breaks up something with lip. That's your clue. In this case, it would be lipids, fats.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 19th biology tutorial and in this lesson I want to talk to you guys about the other type of passive transport that's called Osmosis now before we start talking about this I want to show you guys a little demonstration and throw out a few vocabulary words because it's first one is the solute, which is the salt. So the salt is also called a solute, so L-U-T-E. Now the definition of a solute is inside a solution, which we're looking at right here. It's the substance that's dissolved in another's because whenever we talk about osmosis, it's basically when the definition is when water moves from where it's more pure to areas where it has more solutes. Okay, let's go ahead and open up another slide and see if we can understand this a little bit better. So say that we have some membrane right here. And I'll just go ahead and label this. This is the membrane. And tries to doesn't work out and again my sucrose looks like a thing of grapes why is it that every time I try to draw a molecule bigger than water or oxygen it always end up looking like grapes I don't know but anyways what's gonna happen here is if I grab a let's see I'll grab green so what's gonna happen here is the process called osmosis. It's different than fusion because diffusion is just from areas where it has higher concentration to lower concentration. The key that we need to remember in osmosis is water moves to areas where it has more solutes right there. So that special proteins called active transport proteins what they do is they use the energy in cells to concentrate molecules inside or outside of the cell and actually you know just remember this active transport uses an energy from the cell to move large molecules\", 'Biology'], [\" Now the next phase of meiosis is metaphase 1. So let me go ahead and draw my cell first. Now the first thing that happens in metaphase 1 is that your spindles are going to attach to the centromere of your chromosomes. So here's a spindle right here. And remember that these spindles right here, they actually like to line up on opposite sides of the right here and one right here, that's what causes these chromosomes or tetraids as they are now to line up along the equator of the cell. An anaphase 1. What's going to happen is that So remember, you know, back to the point of pulling the homologous chromosomes apart, homologous chromosomes were matching chromosomes. So that's why you have 46 in your normal cells because you get a set from your mom and a set from your dad. Well now what happened in anaphase 1 is that it pulled the homologous chromosomes apart.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 37th biology video and in this video what I wanted to do is basically continue where we left off in the last video and that's with step 3 and what molecule we had is isositrate Whichitrate, which is an isomer of citric acid. And the first thing it does is it donates a hydrogen atom to NAD plus forming NADH. So actually this is pretty important to remember because in steps three and four we got an NADH. And remember that every one of these molecules is actually going through the process twice. So basically the summary is in step number four of the crypt cycle it forms a CO2 and an NADH and also this molecule which is with this succino instead of the coenzyme, it's going to get released from the molecule and it's going to combine with something called GDP. So now this phosphate gets released and this phosphate, I guess I'll draw it like that, it can get combined, let me pick a new color, with a molecule\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 20 second biology tutorial and in this video I want to talk to you guys about the endoplasmic reticulum and that actually is a very long word to write and also to spell so from now on I'm just gonna call it the ER and if you're like Bucky or just lazy that's not gonna help me remember it at all actually biologists refer to it as the ER a have these dots. Now these dots are actually ribosomes and I'll explain to you guys the difference of why there are ribosomes on some part and why there are not ribosomes on the other part in just a second. Alright, protein right there, or outside your cell. And they just don't chill outside your cell. What I mean to whenever they end up outside the cell, I mean they get sent to other parts of your body. They go through your bloodstream and to wherever they're needed in your body. So here's a protein, here's a protein, and they always come from the rough ER make proteins for your cell membrane and for other parts of your body and the proteins that are made that your cell uses are made by free floating ribosomes. The ones that just float around your cell and aren't stuck to the rough ER. Simple enough. Now let's go ahead and talk about the smooth ER, this part, the part of the ER that isn't covered in ribosomes. Well, the smooth ER is basically responsible. It helps in white and the lipids I'll go ahead and draw those white too. Whenever they're created they get packaged up into these transport vesicles and I'll draw them as yellow. Go ahead and label those. And what happens after that is they get carried from the ER to something called the Golgi apparatus. Now the Golgi apparatus is a whole other organelle that we're going to be talking about in the next sorrel but I just want to explain to you guys that this is what happens\", 'Biology'], [\" Now the fifth rule that all living things must follow is that living things transfer energy among themselves and between themselves and the environment. So let me just go ahead and write transfer energy. Beautiful handwriting. And whenever I say the other part of the rule that living things transfer energy among themselves, I'm talking're going to be talking about reproduction and how life is formed later on, but you pretty much split into and then that split into and you reproduced rule number six, all living things grow and develop. So rule number seven is actually an easy one. And that is just going to reproduce. And basically evolution I just mean that some traits or characteristics take time to develop and they aren't just there all at once. So whenever I talk about evolution I'm gonna go into more detail about this but for right now it would be silly to try to cram it into a couple minute video because there's so much that I have to cover concerning evolution. It's probably gonna take several videos but 7 in 8 are pretty self-explanatory. All living things must repel\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 33rd biology video and in this video I want to pick up where I left off in the last video and that would be a step. Let me draw my step 4 because in the last video we went through steps 1 to 3 and we ended up withomers, which mean they have a different structure or if we were to look at them on a really cool powerful microscope, they would have a different shape. So one of these is the high-dihydroxyacetone phosphate and another one is glyceraldehyde phosphate's the one on the left why not and it turns it into the molecule one. So now let's go to step number six. Now what this enzyme does right here is it takes a hydrogen ion, which is right here. These are parentheses on the left hand and right hand side of that. And it gives that ion 2 and gives it 2. phosphate, again, this is the enzyme that is responsible for this. So once it's done doing all this crap, its job isn't done yet. It takes a phosphate from the cytosol and it adds it's how the phosphate group was bonded on. So now our final product of step six is C3H4O4P2. But remember we have two molecules of these because this step is occurring once for each molecule because remember that main molecule that we were working with\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? Welcome to your 12th biology tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about... nucleic acid. Pretty frickin' sweet. So nucleic acid is actually really important in your body and I say that it's important because first of all without it you Those are the 3 ingredients that you need whenever you make a nucleotide. So I know that all this that it kind of looks like a twisted ladder. And if you ever take that ladder and untwist it, that's what I'm trying to draw right now, even though I may not be the best artist on Earth. So right here, we have your untwisted ladder and DNA, like I said, is made up of two strands of nucleotides, one right here and one right here.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 31st biology video and in this video what I want to do is I want to write out the chemical equations of photosynthesis and also cellular respiration and I want to do this because A, it's important to understand for biology and B, it is amazing how these two equations totally different balance that is make food. Now plants make food, or they make food in the form of sugar, so I guess I'll color sugar this kind of purple color, which C6H12O6. And they also, let me draw my six a little better, and they also create and I'll just go ahead and write 6.02. So six molecules of O2 which is oxygen and whenever it does this it ends up with carbon dioxide which is of course is a byproduct and what color was my carbon dioxide? 6. Now in cellular respiration, the process that people make energy or the cells make energy, they take sugar from, you know, it comes from food and they combine it with oxygen in their bodies and as a byproduct, they have carbon dioxide, water and the all sought after energy that your cell can use for a bunch of different processes. Interesting, but still, I said that this was a very interesting chemical reaction\", 'Biology'], [\" What's up guys, it's Bucky and welcome to your fifth biology tutorial and in this tutorial I want to answer the question that I asked you guys at the end of the last video and that is why are you learning about acids and bases? It seems like it's kind of like a chemistry term and we're talking about biology. So what the heck? Well, remember a couple tutorials ago I said that every living thing is made up of these smaller living things called cells. Now a cell is essentially just a bundle of chemicals in your body needs water. You should drink a lot of water all the time and it's very beneficial\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 15th biology tutorial and in this tutorial we're gonna start talking about cells Now I know that we talked a little bit about cells before and we know things like all living things are made up of the smaller living things called cells and also the cell is basically the smallest living piece of an organism But what I want to do in the next couple of videos is I want to take is you carryouts. So even though you know I know I didn't talk to you guys about the specific types of organelles and what they do, but prokaryotes are cells like bacteria. They're a lot different than animals and plant cells. So I'll just write bacteria are prokaryotes and that's mostly what we're focused on whenever we talk about biology unless you go into a field that specifically studies bacteria or prokaryotes most people are concerned with finding diseases or just learning about the human body so most people are concerned with eukaryotic cells so that's what I'm going to be talking about in the next couple of think that's the more technical term and Another thing that I want to mention real quick is that plant cells Have a special thing called a cell wall so cell wall plants only So again even though that humans animals and plants are all\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? Welcome to your 14th biology tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about something called lipids. Now you may be familiar with lipids because they are actually the fat in your body. So hopefully you aren't too familiar with them but that's what they are and I'll tell you guys how molecules become fat in your body in a second because hopefully you know you can burn the energy before it gets to000 calories in that and I'm like dude that's not a bad thing how many grapes would you have to eat to get 2,000 calories 2,000 calories worth of energy in your body so you know again like I said lipids large molecules but they can pack a to mix together like if you're making I don't know like sugar and water or something and that's because lipids are fats that are hydrophobic doesn't get along well with water. Now scientifically again I'm obviously hungry if I'm talking about cheeseburgers and cookies and stuff but let's go ahead and talk about three types of lipids. of lipid that I want to talk you guys about and that's try try glyceride definitely the most complicated one to see so I guess I might as well say this your liver tries to store all the glucose and remember that the thing that cells use for energy body. So basically, whenever your body can't use glucose, it stores it in glycogen. When your body's done making glycogen, it makes triglycerides, which are the fat that travels through your bloodstream into a special tissue on your body. So that way, the more tissue you have, the fatter you are. And that's kind of why you can't eat too much because if you eat too much, your body doesn't need all the energy. And that's how it stores it\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 18th biology tutorial and in this video I want to discuss how molecules transport across the membrane of a cell because in less tutorial I was like alright you have a cell things can go out things can come in by the bang by the bang that's all there is about transportation But the thing is that's not all there is in that we need to take a closer look at the exact method that molecules across the type of passive transport and that's called diffusion. Diffusion. Now of course whenever we're talking about biology we mean that materials are going to be passing through the cell membrane. But let me go ahead and give you an even more simple example of diffusion. I just, I don't know, kind of a real life example. So if you had, I don't know, a big bucket and you had a screen in the bucket. Now of course sugar what happens is it pretty much is going to dissolve in the water and Of course on the left side right now as soon as we dump it in say that this is I don't know Maybe it's green because we dumped a green pixie stick in there all that sugar is gonna be concentrated in this area on the left hand side of the bucket however over time This is what's gonna happen. So now I we can see just through the process of nature in how things spread out randomly the sugar molecules aren't just gonna you know remain packed on one side for no reason. Even though that there is a screen that's semi permeable they you can see the cell isn't doing anything, it isn't burning any calories, isn't converting any food to energy to make this happen. This is a natural process of the movement of molecules from areas of high concentration. This is high concentration. There are a lot of oxygen molecules out here, too low concentration. I'll just put low number of oxygen molecules. And that's what concentration is.\", 'Biology'], [\" Now, metaphase is the next stage of mitosis. Now, what happens here is we already know that the spindles are attached to the chromosomes. So, what's going to happen is that those spindles are actually going to head to opposite ends or poles of the cell. So, as this happens, go ahead and draw a spindleator of the cell. So that's basically what metaphases the spindles head to opposite ends or poles of the cell and they tug on the chromosomes and whenever they're tugging on them, it causes them to line up in the middle or equator of the cell. That's all going to happen eventually is that this cell is going to split in half and whenever the split in half each new cell, well one copy of each DNA molecule and you know I don't want to jump ahead of that but that's basically a blue. So basically what happens in telephase is the cell is going to form two new nuclear membranes around the chromosomes. So one here and one here. Another thing that happens is these chromosomes are going to uncoil or decondence. Basically what happens in the DNA during is a last stage of mitosis.\", 'Biology'], [\" So guys, welcome to your 30th biology tutorial and in this video I want to talk to you guys about autotrophs and heterotrophs. Now, of course we already know that all organisms, all living things on earth need food for energy. However, what biologists did is they categorized the different types of organisms based on how they obtain their food. They categorize them into two different categories, auto-troves, and these would be things like plants and algae that make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Me, my sun, carbon dioxide and water from the ground. Now what happens during this process is whenever it obtains oxygen to break up food. Now, I already talked to you guys a little bit about this process later on, I mean earlier on. But basically, whenever we use oxygen, and of course we breathe oxygen from the environment, to, you know, they pretty much give off carbon dioxide and plants give off oxygen. Now take a note of this. In order for plants to create food, they need carbon dioxide, which humans and animals give off. And in order for animals to make food, they need oxygen, which is a byproduct of photosynthesis. So I think that's why we say that humans can't use carbon dioxide.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 45th biology video and in this video I'm gonna be talking to you guys about the exact process of DNA replication So at the last video was confusing at all. I promise this one will clear things up So let me go ahead and draw a strand of DNA because basically whenever DNA Repl's not saying much. But anyways, several different enzymes help DNA polymerase work. Basically, several different enzymes are responsible in this process. It isn't just one enzyme that does it all. So the first enzyme I want to talk you guys they're basically temporary. So I'll go ahead and draw these dotted. So this thing right here would be a primer. Might as well label that. And remember that these are temporary right here. Now DNA polymerase 3 is the other important one, but I'm just going to call this DNA polymerase. And that's what this one is. And what this does is it removes the primers. So right now in this strand we have these primers, these pink primers. They probably aren't really pink in your it, by starting and stopping new strands. So basically whenever you have a strand that stops and it needs to be pulled back together obviously, that's when you call DNA ligase to take care of that. So again, as you can see different enzymes or different molecules are responsible, kind of they work as a team in order to replicate don't want your DNA to unravel and just split apart. So what DNA ligase does is it actually forms covalent bonds to fix the breaks in the backbone of DNA. So these are your enzymes. Again, we can already see that cell division is a very complex process using a bunch of different enzymes. But I promise guys, it gets easier later on. So there is your basic of DNA replication.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 56 biology lesson and in this tutorial I want to finish Myosis one by talking about the last phase which is telephase one and also what we're gonna be doing is hopping into myosis to our starting point without the spindles and with our nuclear membrane again. Now the last thing as you can see going to separate the sister chromatids and send them to opposite sides of the cell and we'll talk about that whenever we talk about prophase 2 so actually let me go ahead and open up a new slide in Actually, I want to write this in yellow Prophase 2 So basically what happens is remember we have to\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright, mofos welcome to your 57th biology lesson and in this lesson we're gonna be picking up where you left off with metaphase 2 So remember right now we still have two cells and The key things or key aspects of metaphase 2 is that during metaph have to remember two things is that the spindles attach to the centromere of the chromosomes and also the sister chrometid are going to line up in the middle or the equator of the cell. So after this we move on to anaphase 2. So basically you see what's going on already is your spindles are going to pull apart your chromosomes and your sister crumpets are going to break right at the centromere. So here are your spindles. They succeeded in pulling apart the chromosomes and the area that they break at is right in the middle, right at the centromere of the chromosome. So they what's going to happen is the spindles are going to completely disappear and our nuclear membrane is going to form again and all the cells, bam, bam. And another thing that's going to happen is your chromosomes are going to spread out around the nucleus. So here we go. Here's some chromosomes, DNA spreading out in there and also draw some chromosomes in this color too.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 60th biology lesson and in this video I want to start talking about Mendo's experiments or specifically the results of those experiments So remember that whenever we breed something studying genetics the original parents are called the P1 generation Now their offspring are called the F1 generation or their kids I guess you could say in the second generation of offspring or their grand, people expected the offspring of the F1 generation to be of average height. However, whenever he made it, the results of the offspring were that all of the offspring, no matter how many he made it, they were all tall. So that's kind of weird because this is the first finding. He bred a purebred tall pea So that was one of the most interesting findings and this led to many different theories of why this happens and we'll talk about this later on. But before I continue giving you guys, you know, the details of why this happens, remember that the F2 generation has tall to short of a ratio of three to one. So just to inside your body you have two genes. And we'll say that, I don't know, let's talk about your hair color. So you, yes, I'm talking about you who's watching this video, you have two genes in your body for hair color right now. One is from your mom, it will say that maybe your gene looks like that. And another one is from your dad. Now some genes, as we believed in the 1800s that we proved wasn't true, is that genes and traits don't blend with each other at all. You either have characteristics or the traits from one gene or another, but they don't blend together in any way. So basically to sum everything up, you have two copies of every gene and whenever you have kids, you're only gonna pass one of each gene into your offspring. So basically in this example right here, say this is you,\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? Welcome to your 23rd biology tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about the Golgi apparatus. Now Golgi is actually the dude's name who discovered this thing but in order to understand this organelle what we need of stacked on top of each other like a delicious, delicious stack of Golgi pancakes. So this is the Golgi apparatus right here. And you're saying, okay, why would these proteins and lipids want to take the bus to the Golgi apparatus? Well, with the the other parts of the body where they are needed. So one last time, the Golgi apparatus in order to understand that you need to understand the entire process of what happens. First of all, what the smooth ER does and the rough ER is it makes proteins and lipids and when it's done making those, it gets packaged up into vesicles and moved along to the Golgi apparatus which is right here. Now what the Golgi apparatus does is it kind of acts like a post office, it packages\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 25th biology video and in this video I want to talk to you guys about something called Peroxosomes. Now a lot of people when they're first studying biology they get Peroxosomes and Lysosomes mixed up and the reason for this is because they do have a lot of similarities but in this video what I want to do is to do other stuff later on. Now they are similar to lysosomes in both they look the same in their sax filled with enzymes, but peroxosome actually has a different type of enzyme than a lysosome. So just remember that peroxosomes have different types of enzymes than the digestive enzyme in lysosomes.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 28th biology video and in this video I want to talk to you guys about the two different types of chemical reactions that can happen inside yourself. Now by that I mean anabolic and catabolic. Now these are actually really easy to understand anabolic two or more smaller molecules coming together to form a larger molecule and catabolic is just the opposite. But we also know that it takes energy to bond together molecules. So that's interesting. So why am I saying that? Well, this is the key that we need to take away whenever to be talking about a process called cellular respiration in ATP and all this good stuff.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 38th biology video and in this video we're gonna be finishing up the Krebs cycle because right now we are in step number six There's only eight to go and whenever we left off we left with a molecule called Succinate so what happens in step number six is the very first thing that happens are two hydrogen atoms from the change my slide for step number seven because step number seven is incredibly easy. All you do for step number seven is you add a water molecule to fumarate and it actually makes a brand new molecule called Malate. So this is step number seven that combined to form citric acid. So, wait a minute. You're telling me that after all that time, we got back to a molecule that we started with in step number one? Well, what happens to this molecule right now?\", 'Biology'], [\" Now the second rule that organisms must follow in order to be considered of course living things is that they must maintain order inside their cells and inside their bodies. So I'm just gonna write order right here and what the heck do I mean by maintain order like I don't know line up in a line like the you know army or something well whenever I say maintain order I mean maintain some sort of organization. So remember the first rule said that living things are hunk of cells would not be considered a living things in scientific terms and your body, which is very ordered, organized, would. Now the third rule organisms must follow is that they must regulate their system. So let me just go ahead and write regulation. Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to talk and write at the same time. So what do I mean by about. Maintaining an internal, it doesn't have to be temperature, but any internal conditions that make this organism more able to survive. Now the fourth rule that an she's gonna yell at you, maybe she's gonna throw her cane at you. She's going to respond to signals from the environment in a couple different ways. So that's what I mean to responding to signals from the environment. Non-living things don't at all, living things do.\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? Welcome to your 54th biology lesson and in this lesson we're going to get started talking about the different phases or stages of meiosis. So if you remember from the last tutorial the very first one was prophase 1. So prophase 1 is actually similar to prophase from mitosis in a lot of different ways. So the very first characteristic of prophase is that your chromosomes are going to cond ahead and draw everything I need to draw because it'll be easier if I drive everything first and then talk about it. Alright, so now as you can see what's going to happen is the right hand side will be the result or what happens after the process of crossing over. So again, this process is called crossing over. And you know, it's a little bit different than to go to the mom's chromatid. So what we end up with, unlike before, where we had just two unique chromatid are actually four unique chromatid. So since each chromatid is genetically unique, that's where your sperm nigs are very genetically diverse. And this is actually why because each of these chromatid are eventually going to end up in either a sperm cell or an egg cell in your body, that that's why when you\", 'Biology'], [\" What's going on guys? Welcome to your 26 biology video and in this video I want to talk to you guys about something called the mitochondria. Now the mitochondria is another organelle in the cell and the job of this organelle is to take food that you eat and convert it into energy that your cells can use. Now obviously, you aren't eating constantly. So if that's the case, then your body must store the energy in some kind of way. Well, that's what happens. Whenever the. And I'm just gonna go ahead and draw one mitochondria and it's gonna be a little bit bigger than usual. And this is just to point out the different the entire mitochondria. The matrix, which is the fluid inside, and the inner membrane. And the inner membrane is this right here. Pretty much the membrane that surrounds the\", 'Biology'], [\" So basically what's going to happen is these electrons are going to be passed right into the NADH dehydrogenase which is the first main protein and again it's embedded right in your inner membrane of the mitochondria. So basically as electrons are transferred to your NADH dehydrogenase hydrogen guess this is a good color. So the next thing that they do is they're going to be transferred to a molecule called ubiquinine. So this is ubiquinine right here and I'll draw the electrons from here. So basically so far our electrons next step right here, your hydrogen ions are going to pretty much do the same thing that they did in the first thing, because your hydrogen ions want to be paired with your electrons. So what's going to happen is that one hydrogen ion for each electron is going to be attracted to this and then once it leaves, it's going to bit further. I want to make this diagram freakin' perfect. So this right here that looks like a purple hot dog bun is actually called cytochrome oxidase. So C, nice M. And this is the next molecule that the electrons are headed over. But how do they get over there from the cytochrome BC1 to the cytochrome oxidase? Well, what they do is they need to take another\", 'Biology'], [\" Well, the cytochrome oxidase is actually going to wait till it has four electrons. So right now it has four electrons. So after that it's going to combine with an O2 molecule. And it's going to go ahead and it's going to grab an O2 molecule from the matrix right here. So one of these O2s is going to go right up there. I just don't want to go ahead and keep the arrow there, whatever. And it's also going to combine with eight hydrogen ions are actually going to be shuttle to the other side So basically once everything is combined in here all of your different molecules it's gonna you know have a chemical reaction and you're Basically you have three ingredients electrons and oxygen and hydrogen ions you're gonna It has a little part that is yellow. Again, if you looked at it in your under microscope, it probably wouldn't be yellow, but let me draw much going to have just think of it like two tubes. It has one tube where things can go into it and it has another tube where things can go out of it. Now what's going to happen is these hydrogen ions from this side right here is they're going to enter the top of the ATP synthase one at a time. So one's going to come in and it's going to be an ADP, which I guess I drew like that, and a phosphate, which evidently is pink. In this bottom part right here, once it has enough energy, it can take these two molecules and smash them together. And of course, whenever you combine ADP with another P, it forms a TP,\", 'Biology'], [\" What's going on guys? Welcome to your 24th biology video and in this video I want to talk to you guys about Lysosomes. Lysosomes are special Vescals. They're actually made by the Golgi apparatus and the job of these is basically to clean up your cell. Now by clean up your cell, I mean get rid of all of the harmful stuff in your cell so you're left with only the things that your cell needs. So let me go ahead and draw cell. Here's the nucleus right here. Good looking nucleus. enzymes.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, well into your eighth biology, so I'll end in this lesson. I want to start talking about the different forms of carbohydrates. Now, carbohydrates are a very complex topic and there's a lot of crap to cover about them and they can be classified in several different ways. a carbohydrate and it's also a monosaccharide. Now once we you know get a step above this is called let me go ahead and get a new color. once we talk about sugars and how your body stores energy and different types of carbohydrates, believe it or not, it's actually gonna make sense. So polysaccharide, like I said, are long chains of monosaccharides, sometimes thousands of monosaccharides long. And probably the most common one is starch. So starch is polysaccharide made up of a bunch of glucose. It's like glucose times 1,000. If a bunch of glucose molecules in\", 'Biology'], [\" What's going on guys? Welcome to your 58th biology lesson and in this lesson we're going to start to look at genetics. So what is genetics? Well a really simple explanation is the study of genes and I'm not talking about you know the study of designer genes from them all. I'm talking about the genes in your body. Now the last kind of terminology I want to go over right now is gene because you know that's what genetics is, the study of genes. So a gene is basically a portion of DNA. So is first of all because whenever they are inheriting what you have to give them your traits they get half of the genetic info from their mom and half from you the dad unless you're you know a girl watching these tutorials then to get half from the female half from the male. Now we already know that thanks to meiosis in something called crossing over every single sperm is unique and also whenever you combine it with an egg, the combinations are also unique. Now another thing I want to talk about is mutations. Now mutations are another thing that can cause offspring to be slightly different from the parents and they can actually cause offspring to be very different than the parents in some situations. So when I talk about mutations, let me go ahead and change.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your ninth biology tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about sugars. Sugar is pretty cool, right? Tastes pretty good, but now we have to learn about it scientifically. So an example of some sugars would be like glucose. What did I tell you guys about already? I different names. And sucrose, believe it or not, like I said in the last tutorial, is glucose combined with fructose, however it has a chemical formula of C, let me write this in a different color, be easier to see. C something, it pretty much means makes something. So pretty much if you look at dehydration synthesis, it means that when monosaccharides join together, it involves the two molecules bonding and therefore losing a water molecule. So the opposite of this is hydrolysis. Let me go ahead and get a new slide. Now hydrolysis would be something like C12H22O11, which remember is our disaccharide called sucrose. Now whenever this would break apart, which is the opposite of dehydration synthesis, this process would be called hydrolysis. And of course this would break apart into C12H22O11, which remember is our disaccharide called sucrose. Now whenever this would break apart, which is the opposite of dehydration synthesis, this process would be called hydrolysis. And of course this would break apart into C12H22O11, which is our disaccharide called sucrose. Now whenever this would break apart, which is the opposite of dehydration synthesis, this process would be called hydrolysis. And of course this would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break apart into C12H22O11, which would break So that's why it's called dehydration, which means removal of water, synthesis, which means making something. So dehydration and synthesis whenever you make something and take away water in the process. And the opposite of that is called hydrolysis. And that's S-I-S, okay.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 46 biology video and on this video I want to touch real quick on a subject called leading and lagging strands of DNA. Now actually this subject can take like five different videos but I just want to give you guys a real basic overview just because if I skip over it people are probably gonna you know get mad that I didn't touch on it so let me go ahead and give you guys a real skinny on this. So basically whenever your original DNA or over here? Well this A and C over here are going to get paired with another T and another G. So you're like you know what? Even though it splits and they're not identical at first, you're going to end up with two streams of DNA identical to the original string. Easy enough. So what's really the problem here? Well for me to teach it like this is very some problems for DNA polymerase. So whenever your original parent strand unzips, it's going to split in two strands. Obviously we know that already. Now the piece that's going to be one continuous piece right here is going to be called the leading strand. So L E A D I N G. Now if you were to look at DNA be over here, you know, if this were a proper diagram. And what it would do is it would be putting together these pieces or these chunks using covalent bonds. So one last time what happens is whenever your original parent strand of DNA splits, you have two strands that are complementary. One is the leading strand that grows in one continuous piece and the other is the lagging strand and this grows in chunks or fragments.\", 'Biology'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought? Congress. That's who. Okay, clones, we get the picture. There's a debate about the role of the Constitution in setting up the government, and we're not going to solve it today. For now, we're going to start with the Constitution and what it says about the president. You win this round. Clone from the nation's chief diplomat, which is the source of his foreign policy power. The president can also propose laws, although he has to get a congressman or senator to actually introduce them into Congress. This is a legislative power. And since he's the chief executive, he also has executive power, which means that he's supposed to ensure that the laws are carried out. This is his most far-reaching power, probably while he was president, and that was George Washington. The whiskey rebellion. That's something we're fighting over. The president has diplomatic powers, although he doesn't actually do most of the diplomacy. The president has the power to make treaties, which are mostly written by the State Department officials, but he takes credit. He appoints ambassadors in those State Department officials I just mentioned. His most visible foreign policy power is to receive ambassadors, which not only makes for great photo prosecution, in which case it's a very big deal. So there you have it. Those are the formal constitutional powers of the President of the United States. You may have noticed that there aren't all that many of them, which is kind of the point. The framers of the Constitution wanted a limited government, one that couldn't oppress the people. They were especially afraid of a strong executive like a king in charge of a standing army, so they deliberately tried to curtail his powers by not giving him very many. But as we'll see in the next few episodes, over the course of the last 240 years or so, the powers of the President have expanded far beyond what the framers probably envisioned.

It comes from my mind brain and yours and stands, although no one really cares to hear from stands mind brain. Just kidding Stan. You're crying. Political ideologies are specific to individuals, but right now we're going to try to explain the factors that shape public opinion in engaging in public relations maneuvers and manipulating the news cycle. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The President is especially good at controlling the news cycle since he can go on television whenever he wants. The idea that the President might be at the center of the news started in the 20th century, probably about how much better the government was back in the 50s and early 60s. But that might be a reflection of the generally robust economy and a cold war consensus that criticizing the government was on patriotic, you communist sympathizer. And if you. The growth of the Internet as a source of news, information and advertising has lowered the cost of public relations and makes it easier for specific interest groups to get their messages out, like the time I tumbled about how the dress was totally black and blue. Often the group that's better at swaying public opinion has more money. A great example of how an interest group with a lot of money and a single issue can shape our opinion. The main way that the media shapes public opinion is by choosing what stories to cover and not cover. It's pretty hard to have an opinion on a topic if you know nothing about it, although many would say it's getting easier and easier, at least on Twitter. One way the media shapes what we know is through what is called priming. That's when you put a coat of prime around the house before you paint it. The paint sticks real good. No. This is when the media prepares the public to take a particular view of an issue often through the amount of coverage it gives. For example as well as your ability to click on the video and play it. So, and watch it again, even though it's two years old. Thanks for watching. See you next time.

We're right into the table there a little bit. Ooh, economic policy can be dangerous. Specifically, we're going to look at some of the broad goals of economic policy and some of the things that the government does to try to accomplish those goals. And we may even provide some examples of times when the government did accomplish them. So take that, skeptics. But I have to admit, a lot of the time the ways, okay, interesting to me, that the government keeps markets predictable is their national regulations of things like automobile fuel efficiency standards. If there were no national regulations and states were allowed to set the rules, then it might be possible for car makers in Detroit to build cars that live up to the mileage standards in Michigan, but not in California, and that would be anarchy. Well, maybe not anarchy, exactly, but it wouldn't be good, and it'd make it much more difficult for manufacturers to know what kind of cars to make. Also, do you really want California, the state with the biggest uses to control inflation is the Federal Reserve, which is so complicated that it gets its own episode. Third goal of government economic policy, one closely related to the first two, is promoting business development. Many people would probably argue that promoting business development and promoting prosperity are the same thing, but policies aimed at helping businesses are slightly different and more focused than those targeting the broader goal of promoting prosperity. The main ways that the federal government promotes business development are through tariffs and subsidies. Since the Great Depression. But these days critics worry that most of the subsidies go to corporate farms. The fourth goal of government economic policy is to protect consumers and employees. A lot of people will tell you that the federal government doesn't do much to protect employees these days, and those people are probably right. But in the past, mostly about the role the government plays in our economy. Please invite me to those dinner parties. I'm hungry for roast beef and political debate. So to shift gears a little, let's talk history and how the government's role in regulating the economy has changed in the last 240 years or so. So you probably remember from back when we Commerce Act in 1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroads. The period of time around the turn of the 20th century in the US is known as the Gilded Age, and is associated with runaway capitalism and the creation of modern corporate structures and industrial capitalists, like Andrew Carnegie, or Carnegie, if you will, and John D. Rockefeller, who are heroes to some and villains to others. In response to some of the abuses of the Gilded Age airplanes. The next big wave of government regulation happened in the early 1970s under, of all people, President Nixon. These new regulatory laws were different from their new deal predecessors in that they focused on the economy as a whole. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration dealt with all occupations, or at least most of them, and the EPA was created to protect the whole country's environment. Beginning in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan, or actually before him under Carter, the federal government has undertaken various initiatives to deregulate the economy. But we already talked about deregulation in our episode on taming the bureaucracy, so we don't need\", 'Politics'], [\" Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today I'm going to take a deep dive into Political Science Theory and try to figure out why interest groups form. So grab your snorkel, no, there's a deep dive, grab your scuba gear. I know, I know, you're probably thinking that interest groups form to influence the government with their piles and piles of cash. So the way they form is by amassing piles of cash and then, well, who really cares once they have all that cash? Maybe that's true, but why we have some interests that get together and because you know, building a road is hard. Although there are obviously some situations where people can coordinate to get things done without any government intervention, most of the time if you want to accomplish big things like the Hoover Dam, or building the highway systems, you need some sort of government action to make sure it gets done. And usually it gets done when the government collects taxes from everybody to build the road. Now, some people may use the road a lot more than their taxes paid for, and some may or woman, young person. What this means in practice is that smaller groups are more successful in forming and in pushing their agenda. This is why producers are more successful at forming interest groups than consumers, and why business owners are usually more successful than workers. Now, many people will say that in the US, labor is well represented through unions, but over the last 40 years at least, union membership and the dudes that come with it are of a group you are helping to make a difference. Purpose of benefits partially explain why so many people joined up with groups during the civil rights movements. It certainly wasn't for the SNCC keychains. Another way that interest groups can be formed is by political entrepreneurs. These are specific individuals who make extraordinary efforts to bring people together for the purpose of changing policy. Often political entrepreneurs are politicians who recognize the latent potential of groups that haven't yet organized. When successful, they benefit elected officials and also using the courts. Actual direct lobbying of congressmen has become more difficult over the years. Congress has passed laws that have limited the ability to deduct lobbying expenses from taxes and restricted how much lobbyists can pay for officials' travel expenses. This has cut down a lot on the famous political junkets, which often looked like a vacation paid for by lobbyists. Congress has also passed laws limiting the gifts that lobbyists can strategies are called grassroots lobbying. Mobilizing public opinion is sometimes called going public. But this is very confusing because it's the same term used to describe the president's making direct appeals to public opinion. And also what happens when a company floats its stock on an exchange for the first time. When interest groups go public, the main things they do are groups are all about change in policies, and they pursue both insider and outsider strategies to influence policymakers. I hope that we've given you a balanced view of interest groups, one that's not so cynical about the way they function in our politics. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

Team Jacob and Team Edward have those. Last, and in the eyes of many people, at least, is the judicial branch. The job of the judiciary, also sometimes called the courts, which I'm going to call the courts because judiciary is really hard to say, is to interpret the law try to balance their checkbooks. Anyway, the point here is that each of the branches has the power to limit or check the other two, and this creates a balance between the three separate powers. In the same way that the Constitution lays out the legislature in the greatest detail, it also gives the legislature the greatest number of checks on the other branches. Legislative clone? So the framers of the Constitution were really concerned about the president becoming a tyrannical figure, Allah King George III. That guy was a federal court system by adding or taking away courts like it says in Article 3. And it can change the jurisdiction of federal courts. Congress can pass new laws that override Supreme Court decisions as long as the decisions aren't based on the Constitution. Don't want to do that. No. And as a very last super drastic resort, Congress can propose amendments to the Constitution as it did with the 13th, 14th have a whole lot to do. Being the weakest branch, the judiciary also has the fewest checks on the other two branches. Here's what it can do. The judiciary checks the legislature by declaring its laws unconstitutional. The chief justice presides over impeachment trials and sometimes he gets to wear a special robe when this happens. Perk for the government to act in ways that harm the rights and interests of the citizens. One of the best explanations of this comes from, you guessed it, the Federalist Papers. In this case, Federalist 51, which was written by James Madison, who also wrote a lot of the Constitution and became President. So he kind of knows what he's talking about and really it's a shame that he's not on our money because then Americans would pay him more attention. They would also pay him, literally.

I have a lot of social policies which include not staying out past 3am on weeknights and avoiding social gatherings where a Velveeta sausage cheese dip is served. Both of these are pretty loosely enforced though. Actually we're talking about government social policy which deals government action and generally favors private charity and pull yourself up by your bootstraps self-reliance. I've never worn bootstraps. Stan, does that make me a true American? As you might have guessed, the history of the American government's social policy pretty much starts as most government programs do with the new deal. Prior to the 1930s, there were some attempts on the state level to protect workers public opinion polls, and who doesn't, then Social Security is one of the most successful New Deal programs ever. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Started in 1935, the Social Security Act was a reaction to the fact that many elderly people in the US were poor, largely because they had no work, little savings and no pensions. Social Security provided monthly payments to people over age 65, and while tax that phases out at higher incomes, rather than a more progressive one that hits higher earners harder.

Also, during economic downturns, as in two an argue over with your friends and families and teachers and teachers teachers and teachers grammars and Guy McDonald's maybe the guy standing next to you at the the velveita sausage cheese dip platter but it's important to remember that social policy isn't just redistribution of wealth or income it's also education and programs that help people who really can't help themselves thanks for watching see you next time crash course government politics is produced in association with PBS digital studios support for crash course us government comes from vocal vocal supports nonprofits that use technology and media\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today I'm going to talk to you about something that affects almost everybody, jobs. Unless you are very lucky or very unlucky, at some point in your life you will probably have a job and more likely than not you will be employed by someone else. The big boss. The person who tells you what to do. Stan, are you my boss? I'm more of a contractor. The rules about what employers can and can't do are very complicated and changing all the time but one thing they are not allowed or at least in the past, Irish people. All of the groups I just mentioned share one common characteristic, at least where the courts are concerned. And this is that the thing that makes them a discrete group is something that they can't change. Now current ideas about sex and gender make this characterization more problematic than the Supreme Court likes to think, but Supreme Court justices weren't always the most progressive. Also problematic is religion, since we are free to adopt or discard religions as we want. But I guess that since religion is specifically mentioned in the First Amendment, and that when the laws, but most of the actual rules against discrimination come out of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and various state anti-discrimination statutes. This is one of the most far-reaching and important pieces of federal legislation ever, and its history is fascinating, but we're not going to get too much into it here least under federal law? First, you have to be in a protected class as defined by the law, which means that you will need to show that discrimination was based on your race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Now, sometimes this will be easy to prove, like in a case where your employer says, I'd give you a promotion if you weren't black. Or, gee, I'm sorry to let you go, but you know you're a woman and we can't have too many women working here. the protected group. Much of the evidence to show this will probably be statistical. And it may be hard to get, which points out a crucial thing about discrimination claims. They are hard to prove. Thanks Thought Bubble. By now I bet many of you are saying, Craig, I thought you said you were going to focus mainly on women, but the discrimination you've been describing applies to all sorts of protected groups.

You have made it to the final Crash Course Government and Politics video! Woo! Today we're going to look at the mystifying paradox of both the least and most important aspect of government, foreign policy. Foreign policy is the most important because it has potential to affect the largest number of people, especially if you include environmental policy, which we should. Also, foreign policy includes goals. Of course, foreign policy is about providing security, but American foreign policy also seeks to create prosperity and works towards a somewhat idealistic goal of making the world a better place. Security has many facets, and like most things, it has grown more complex over time. It used to simply mean being able to repel invaders. Nope, not the Mongols, more like the British. Now, however, in addition to physical security, foreign policy encompasses transportation has much effect on terrorists, and since 2001, America has pursued a global war on terror, that as we saw in Iraq, includes the doctrine of pre-emptive war to forestall potential threats. Although military force may be the most visible form of US foreign policy, it might not be the most useful. For one thing, it's generally seen as a last resort, which I'd say is a good thing. It sovereignty. But in reality, international law is a huge part of American foreign policy. The US also engages in international peacekeeping missions, and international peace certainly makes the world a better place. America doesn't usually commit its soldiers to UN peacekeeping missions, preferring to make its own coalitions or work through NATO, which by the way is an example of international security agreement too. See, there's a lot of overlap here. Another way the US makes the world a better place is through international environmental policy. Again, that's my environmental policy. Keep Eagles away from it. Thought bubble for Crash Course Government and Politics. Woooo! money to pursue a policy, and it takes a purse to hold money. And especially in the area of defense, Congress appropriates a lot of it. Money not purses. Contrary to popular belief, though, Congress hasn't budgeted a lot of money for other types of foreign policy, especially aid to foreign nations. Thanks, Thought Bubble. I miss you. Congressional committees,ically-based interest groups that can often lobby very vocally, as some Irish Americans did during the 1980s. Interest groups that coalesce around issues have been growing in importance, especially as communication technologies enable them to get their message to a wider audience, and to organize grassroots lobbying efforts. In general, environmental groups are more effective at organizing\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government. Ah, it's been a dream of mine to be on Crash Course since I was a little kid. Speaking of acting like a little kid, today we're going to talk about the US Congress, which, according to the Constitution, is the most important branch of government. That was probably written by Congress. It wasn't. They didn't exist yet. So when I say that Congress is supposed to be the most important branch of government, I'm talking about the national government, not the state government. There's a difference. Okay. I know this because of the Constitution, a state of enjoyment. college. I'll explain this later, but for now remember that this barely ever has happened ever. The third power that belongs specifically to the House is found in Article 1, Section 7. Old Bill's raising revenue show originated in the House of Representatives. This is pretty important because it means that any bill that raises taxes that when the Constitution was being written, the framers couldn't agree on what type of legislature to have because they came from states with different interests. Delegates from states with large populations wanted legislators to be chosen based on the state's population so that their states would have, wait for it, more legislators and more power. This is called proportional representation. States with small populations understandably didn't want proportional representation. They favored equal representation in the legislature, which would give them equal power. James Madison might not have sounded like Foghorn like Hoard, but that's one of the house. It was supposed to be more immune from the desires of the public, which the framers were kind of afraid of because of their unfortunate propensity to riot. One of the ways that the framers hoped to ensure this was by giving senators a six-year term, which really would mean that they could ignore the rantings and ravings of their constituents for at least, like, five years at a time. Because the senator is supposed to be the more deliberative body and the one that is more insulated from public opinion, they're the ones given the branch of government that's closest to the people. After all, one thing that the government does that is directly related to almost everybody is taxes, so you want the most democratic body making decisions that have the most direct effect on people.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government and Politics. And today we're going to talk about what is, if you ask the general public, the most important part of politics. Elections. If you ask me, it's hairstyles. Look at Martin Van Buren's sideburns. How could he not be elected? Americans are kind of obsessed with elections. I mean, when this was being recorded in early 2015, television news and the internet way we discuss politics, elections aren't really a big feature of the Constitution. Except, of course, for the ridiculously complex electoral college system for choosing the President, which are so unpopulated as to have only one representative. Sometimes these elections are called at large elections. Before the election ever happens, you need candidates. How candidates are chosen differs from state to state, but usually it has something to'm sure the numbers will be much higher, like a gajillion... billion. Million. Money is important in winning an election, but even more important, statistically at least, is already being in Congress. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The person holding an office who runs for that office again is called the incumbent, and has a big advantage over any challenger. This is congressman to raise money, which helps them win. And long-term incumbents tend to be more powerful in Congress, which makes it even easier for them to raise money and win. The Constitution gives incumbents one structural advantage, too. Each elected congressman is allowed $100,000 in free postage to send out election materials. This is called the franking privilege. It's not so clear how great an advantage this is in the age of the Internet's, but at least according to the book The Victory Lab, direct' behavior and activities into three watching.

At last, we're finally going to hear a fair and balanced account of how the lamestream media is distorting the American public's understanding of current affairs. Yeah, sure, except for the segment of the American public that gets all of their information from right-wing media sources. Okay, so the media can be a thorny issue. But we are talking about politics here and technically we are a no longer the main source of information for Americans, but it sure used to be, especially in the days when some large cities had papers that would put out a morning and afternoon edition. But just because fewer people are reading print media doesn't mean that they aren't very important. For one thing, most of the other news media organizations rely on print for their news. Newspapers, like The New York Times and The Washington Post, still break most major news stories and provide but there are a few things we can say. As a news source, the primary advantage of the internet is that it can up the possibility of a lot more non-commercial supported information they have the discretion to report and interpret the news. If you think the news is just the facts, then it's useful to remember that the New York Times slogan used to be, all the news that's fit to print. Do reporters have a bias towards one political ideology or another? Probably. More journalists identify as liberal and as Democrats than say they are conservative or Republican. The next factor to consider is the source of political news, the politicians themselves. Politicians do a lot of things to create a of producing information. But advocates of responsible journalism worry a lot about them because, coming directly from politicians, they're certain to be biased, and when they're reported as straight news, they can be misleading.

Whipping them in the line, I suppose. The third line is the house majority leader who helps the majority and probably does other stuff. But mainly he's chosen by the speaker because he's popular with particular factions within the party. The minority party, that's the one with fewer members elected in a term, duh. Also has a minority leader and the minority whip, but no speaker. The President Pro Tem is a largely ceremonial role that is given to the most senior member of the majority party. Senior here means longest serving, not necessarily oldest, although it can be the same thing. No one would want to be a congressional leader if there was no power involved, so it's important to know what powers these folks have and how they exercise them. Also, I'm not supposed to do this, but let's go to the Thought Bubble. I love saying that. The primary way also rather difficult for the media to discuss an issue that's never brought up, no matter how much the public might ask. But why don't you talk about this thing that matters a lot to me? Thanks Thought Bubble. Speaking of the media, congressional leaders can also wield power because they have greater access to the press and especially TV. That's the thing It's contained in the phrase majority rules. This is especially true in the House, where the majority party chooses the Speaker, but it's also the case in the Senate. This is why ultimately political parties organize and raise so much money to win elections. If one of the parties controls both houses and the presidency, as the Democrats did in 2008 through 2009, that party is for Speaker Boehner to put forward an agenda. The Tea Party caucus felt Boehner compromised too much with the Democrats, even though his agenda was, by some standards, pretty conservative. As a result, Congress wasn't able to get much done, except make itself unpopular. So, if you combine all this with the stuff we learned about congressional committees, you should have a pretty good understanding of how Congress actually works. Yay!

We're not going to Slow Jam it Stan! Instead, beer-crat Jimmy and I are going to give you some tools you need to better understand Department of Justice, and the FDA is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. There are also independent agencies that are very similar to executive departments because their heads require Senate confirmation. Well, their whole body requires. I'm talking about the head like they're the boss, the head of the agency. The best example here is the CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, but NASA is another independent agency. Next we have the Independent Regulatory Commissions, which are supposed to by testing and approving new drugs, the Centers for Disease Control, which tries to do exactly what the name suggests, and the National Institutes of Health, which, among other things, sponsors research that improves citizens' health. All of these agencies are under the auspices of the Department of Health and Human Services. Another good example of a client-serving agency is the Department of Agriculture, which, in addition to rating meat, administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is another function of bureaucracies that is even more complex and controversial. Most of these agencies, like the Social Security Administration, provide direct services so we can see the overlap between the function of agencies. Thanks, Thought Bubble. I've been suggesting that even though they aren't mentioned in the Constitution, bureaucracies are pretty powerful, so I should probably explain where that power comes from. Basically, Thor's hammer. Actually, no, it doesn't come from that at all. It comes from Congress, which as we've seen delegates power to executive agencies\", 'Politics'], [\" Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics. Today I'm going to talk a little bit about the media. Specifically, the way the media interacts with the government itself. And more specifically, the way the government regulates the media. Some of you might be saying, Craig, get real. The government doesn't regulate the media. We live in a free market capitalist society and the only real regulation on what gets published or broadcast is determined by consumers, Craig, right on. Except that there are things you can't say on television or print in a New York Times v. U.S. the Pentagon Papers case made it difficult for the government to use national security as an excuse to prevent publication of sensitive or in that case embarrassing material. There's still libel laws that allow individuals to sue newspapers and magazines when they print something that they don't like. But as far as public figures are concerned the Supreme Court's decision in New York Times v. Sullivan makes it pretty hard to censor the press by suing for libel. So I can say anything I want about public figures. Public figures always are. The licenses are granted and most of the government regulation of broadcasters is managed by the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC. It was founded in 1934 to oversee a chaotic radio industry and it soon expanded to include television. As part of its mission, the FCC required that in order for a station to be granted a license, it had to show that it was operating in the public interest. In terms of politics, this meant that the FCC has come up with some rules regarding what gets broadcast. Every channel has to have a CSI. The FCC rule that deals with media ownership, but I'm going to talk about that later because the FCC didn't tell me I can't. The FCC also regulates what can be broadcast, but these rules don't relate to politics so much as obscenity, indecency, or profanity showing up on radio or television. Sometimes these FCC rulings and fines become Supreme Court cases as people raise concerns about whether they deny our precious, precious free speech. One of the most famous cases in this area, FCC versus Pacifica Broadcasting, dealt with comedian George Carlin's seven words routine, it's largely self-regulating. This is possibly because Congress has recognized that it changes so quickly that most laws and regulations will be out of date by the time they are finally written. This hasn't stopped them from trying. After the courts struck down the Communications Decency Act, Congress tried again with the Child Online Protection Act in 1998. And they failed. This one didn't make it all the way to the Supreme Court, but lower federal courts enjoined the government from enforcing it in 2007. A more effective way to regulate the monopolization of the media as more and more companies merge. And it's hard to argue that this isn't happening. So the number of companies that provide media content and access has been shrinking precipitously in the past 30 years, which is probably why the FCC and Congress scrutinize media mergers so closely. Critics point out just another set of corporations that take their cues from the market are getting at something. The media is different from other corporate entities because it serves a public function, something that the framers realize when they wrote freedom of the press into the First Amendment. Without a robust media, Americans may have less access to information that they need to make smarter political choices.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government and Politics and today I'm going to talk about a topic in American politics that tends to drive people crazy! AHHHHH! No, it's not partisanship or horse race journalism or the state of political punditry, although we could easily do episodes on all three of those. And we might. Nope, today we're going to look at the election districts and how they shape electoral outcomes and that means you guessed it, we're going to talk about gerrymandering. Thank and the state of loneliness. One is the loneliest number. In those sparsely populated states, figuring out the election district, which geographic areas represented by a congressman, is easy because there's only one district. This makes elections in these states effectively at large elections, like a state's choice for senator. Even though there are two senators from each state, they represent the entire state at large rather than only a part of it, like representatives are supposed to do. The to 800,000 people, which is still a lot, but much better than one senator for 19 million Californians or 13 million Texans. The idea that people should be equally represented in Congress shouldn't be controversial, and for the most part, it's not. What is controversial is the way that minority groups are represented. One of the problems with single-member districts is that they can make it easier to cut minority groups out of the political landscape. After all, if in a given state, only 15% just draw districts to make them equal in population. They draw them to capture certain population characteristics, so that one party has a greater chance of electing a member from a particular district. In the district pictured here, the Illinois 4th Chicago has been carved up to capture a certain population. Me. That's a district I live in. Usually districts are drawn so that they can capture my vote. Or a significant majority of one party or the this in 2003, not a census year, prompting its Democrats to run away to Oklahoma for a spell. Second, it's possible for a state to hand the task over to a less biased, expert, district-drawing person, or group that might make districts more fair. Hand it over to me. I'll make them all look like little bunnies. But wait, you might ask yourself, what's wrong with this system, and why do people think it's unfair? Let's go to the Thought Bubble. perhaps, they all tend to concentrate in urban areas around Cleveland and Columbus, so that the overwhelming majority of the state's districts are won by Republicans. Thanks Thought Bubble. Congressional districting is fascinating and really, really important for determining the composition of Congress, but it's also quite complicated, which, as with most things, makes it difficult to understand. But unlike some other complicated issues concerning policy, gerrymandering is one that's easy to criticize because the visual results are so striking and because it can result in\", 'Politics'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace. The Fair enough, but it doesn't explain why Congress delegates powers to the executive branch. For this, I think we need a little help from the Thought Bubble. There are three reasons that Congress delegates power to the executive branch. Practical reasons, historical reasons, and political reasons. To start with the practical reasons, Congress delegates power because it has to. Today's government, whether you like it or not, does a lot of things today. The key thing to remember is that the new deal was primarily a legislative program of laws that created new agencies and programs, not just a series of executive orders. Thanks, Thought Bubble. The political reasons for delegation may sound cynical, and I guess they are, but they reflect the political reality that getting blamed for a bad outcome can cost you an election. Often, Congress tends to delegate to the executive branch too. The second important thing to remember about delegation is that overall it represents a shift of power from the legislative to the executive branch. Why this has happened is complicated and whether it's a good thing or a bad thing is an important and interesting discussion that you should have in your classes and with your friends and with your grandma and with your grandma's friends. But that it has happened is a fact that you and your grandma and your grandma's friend need to recognize. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

And no, we're not going to be talking about the laws of thermodynamics. That's Hank's show, though we will be bringing the heat. The law affects you even if you never committed a crime because there's so much more to the legal system than just criminal justice. And even though we're going to focus mainly on courts, the law is everywhere. If you don't believe me, read the user license on your next new piece of famous careless errors in that. Finally, courts create expectations for future actions. This is very important if you want to do business with someone. If you know that you'll be punished for cheating a potential business client, you're less likely to do it. Still, you might, because there are a lot of jerks out there who would. Are you one of them? Don't be. At the same time, if you know that people will be punished for cheating you, you're more likely to do business. And it's courts that create the expectation that business will be conducted fairly. Interpreting the laws can help this too, since the interpretations are public and they system is that you should know that the federal judges are appointed for life and their salaries can't be reduced. This is to preserve their independence from politics. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal. Remember when I told you that the legislature makes the laws? Well, that was true. But it's also not the whole story. Legislatures both state and national make laws, and these written laws are called statutes. In continental Europe, those are pretty much all the laws they have. Statutes. Statutes everywhere. And statutes. That place is filled with art. They had the Renaissance there, you know? But in the US and England, which is where court hears the facts of a case, it decides the outcome by applying the relevant law. What law they apply will depend on statutes, and in some cases, what other courts have said in similar situations. In other words, the common law. You might have noticed that I've been referring to courts, not judges or juries, because not all trials have juries. Bench trials have only a judge who determines the facts and the law. Besides, who decides what in a court case isn't really that important. More than 90% of cases never go to court, of law's public law. Public law smash abuse of government authorities. If you watch TV or movies or read John Grisham novels, you're probably familiar with criminal law. Criminal laws are almost always statutes written by legislatures, which means that there is an actual law for you to break. In most states, the criminal laws are called the penal codes. In a criminal dispute, and it's a dispute because the government says you broke the law and exposed to gamma rays.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to try to untangle the mess that is the American Political Campaign. One of the things about the American political system that often confuses people who don't live in America is the way that our politicians run for office. There are two aspects in particular that stand out about American political campaigns. Their length and their expense. We're going to look at both of these today and we'll see that they're related but before we do we need to answer a burning question. Why do we need political campaigns anyway? Can you guess what they stand for? book pages. There are even campaign ads made specifically for YouTube, although how their advertising algorithm works is beyond me. It's weird to get a campaign ad for the Michigan Senate if you don't live in Michigan. One other way that campaigns communicate information is through raising money. Of course, they need money to pay for all the campaign ribbons and buttons and PA systems and folding chairs and tour buses and stump speeches and axes to chop down trees so they have stumps to speak on. These things ain't cheap. is that they rely increasingly on the TV and other visual media that cost a lot of money to produce. Gone are the days when William McKinley could sit on his porch in Ohio and have reporters come to him. Nowadays, even when candidates get free exposure by appearing on nightly comedy shows like The Daily Show, it still costs the campaign in terms of time, travel, and probably wardrobe and makeup so that they can look as good as lots of people. Recognizing that campaign contributions could potentially influence the political process, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971. This was the first law that put limits on campaign spending and donations. It was further refined by the McCain-Finegold campaign law in 2002, and by court decisions that refined the rules for campaign spending and donations, and provided illegal rationale for these limits. Until recently, the most important case on campaign finance was Buckley v. Vallejo. This case established the idea that limits on campaign spending were problematic under the First himself, well, you can see why the line between issue advocacy and support for a political campaign can be kind of blurry. Now here's something very important. These limitations are on contributions to candidates and campaigns, not on spending by candidates and campaigns. What this means is that a candidate and their campaign can spend however much they raise. So if a candidate running for office has $1 billion, they can spend $1 billion trying to win. There's no concern about self-funded candidates bribing themselves, and you often see very rich people spending a lot of their own money trying to win office. So Buckley versus Valle spend on elections doesn't seem like so much, which may make us rethink the idea that money is corrupting American politics. Or maybe not. Maybe potato chips are corrupting American politics. Certainly corrupting my belly. American political campaigns are big, and high stakes, and raise questions about the influence of money in politics that are tough to answer. On the one hand, it does seem like there's the potential for very rich people to have a lot of influence over elections. On the other hand, limiting a person's ability to register his or her preference for a candidate through spending on that candidate does seem like a limitation on their political speech.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to finally get into why many people, including me, think that the 14th Amendment is the most important part of the Constitution. At the same time, we'll attempt successfully, I hope, to unravel the difference between civil liberties and civil rights and also try to figure out how the Supreme Court actually looks at civil rights and civil liberties cases. So that's a lot. Let's get this out of the way because we're not could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based on color or to enforce social as distinguished from political equality. And they confirmed that as long as the state provided equal accommodations for people of different races, segregation was fine. This is the infamous separate but equal doctrine that was formulated in the case, Plessy versus Ferguson. The distinction between social and political equality is an important one, and it provides a principle for looking at discrimination that the courts still use. Unfortunately, it's pretty complicated, and it means that we have to look at something that's kind of confusing, levels is in the footnote too. It's because minorities, by definition, are at a huge disadvantage in the democratic political process. Their numbers are too small to pass laws that might favor them. And it's easy for groups in the majority to pass laws that will disadvantage groups that are not in the majority. And this gets at the heart of the distinction between civil liberties which deal with government actions and civil rights, which deal with majority groups making life hard for minority groups. You may not like this distinction, but it does have the virtue of being based on a principle. Basically, the Unfortunately, this did happen during World War II when Japanese Americans were interned, but it's a bad example of strict scrutiny since in that case the court ruling in the case of Korematsu versus US let the government's action stand. Third, let's look at whether the law or executive action places an undue burden on the person or group in question. Let's say a state requires literacy tests for voting, which can be burdensome or not depending on the court will say they are okay. As you might expect, this gives the government a lot of leeway with its laws. And between strict scrutiny and rational basis review is something called mid-z scrutiny. Nope, intermediate scrutiny. It's a harder standard to meet than rational basis, but it doesn't mean that the government usually loses, like with strict scrutiny. Why doesn't the government consult me about naming things? Okay, so now we have a sense of what civil rights are and why the courts look at civil rights cases in the way that they do. It seems in something as local as public education when racial discrimination was involved. And more important, it showed that states couldn't use race as a criterion for setting up public schools. It was the legal basis of what we know as the American Civil Rights Movement and provided the foundation for the federal civil rights legislation of the 1960s. So I got a little into history there, sorry about that. I know this is Crash Course Government and not Crash Course History, but with civil rights it's kind of hard not to. That's because, unlike with civil liberties, which are pretty much defined by the Bill of Rights,\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're talking about free speech. Finally today we can let loose and establish the kinds of things we can say to criticize our government like the crazy idea that money and speech are the same thing. Not so fast, clone. The Supreme Court has ruled that spending money, at least. What this means is that you don't have an absolute right to say whatever you want, wherever you want, to whomever you want, and not suffer any consequences. Isn't that right, Stan? You dangus. I'm fired? I was just kidding, it was a joke. Unless, of course, your advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent action and is likely to produce such action. According to the court, the First Amendment protects speech even if it advocates the use of force or encourages people to violate the law. So you can advocate overthrowing the government or not paying your taxes as much as you want, unless what you say is likely to produce the thing you're advocating, overthrowing the government's sex. And it is likely to happen imminently, meaning very soon after you make the statement. This case limited in an older standard regarding free speech that was put forward you're a high school student who a letter to the editor of his local paper complaining about the way that the school board was spending money on the schools. He didn't write it on school time or using school paper or email, especially since it was 1968, and there was no email. The school board, or his principal, fired him. He brought the case to the Supreme Court claiming that he was fired for his speech, which was political in nature, criticizing local government, and not for anything related to his job performance. And he won. But the only reason he was able to get his job back is that\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics. Today we're going to talk about bureaucracies just as soon as I finish filling out these forms. Do I really have to initial hear, hear, and hear on all three copies stand? Regulation say so? Alright. I'm just kidding. I don't really have to fill out forms in Triplekit in order to make an episode of Crash Course. But this kind of stuff is one of the main reasons that people don't like bureaucracies. Americans tend to associate them with incomprehensible rules and big government is, and at least this respect, bogus. Or what I like to call, a false dichotomy. Is that too pretentious to say false dichotomy, Stan? I don't care. I'm saying it. False dichotomy. So if people hate bureaucracies so much and compare them unfavorably with Google and Amazon, why do we have them? Well, the main reason is that bureaucracies are efficient. They make. So let's go Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, the first reason we keep bureaucracies is because bureaucracies are useful. They do get things done, even though it might not be as quickly as we'd like, and some of these things are things we want done, like inspecting our meat so we don't get E. coli or salmonella or mad cow disease. One response to this that we'll talk bureaucracies is a certain amount of stability and the built up expertise that comes with it. Probably the main reason why we don't change bureaucracies though is that doing so is really difficult. Once Congress makes a bureaucracy, it's usually permanent for a number of practical and political reasons. We'll get into those reasons next time. So I'm going to wrap this up with a little bit of a reminder about federalism based on a largely unwarranted assertion. I bet that if you ask most Americans to give an example of a bureaucracy, they will say the DMV. Most people will tell you a DMV horror story of the time they had to wait in line for four hours just to renew\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics. As fans of our series know, here at Crash Course we believe in hierarchy. First at the top you got me, then there's John Green, then Stan, then Brandon, then Zilea, then a bunch of independent contractor. Wait, I'm an independent contractor. But I'm still at the top. Anyway, then the rest of its turtles all the way down. Except at the bottom. There's an eagle. Anyway, it's the strict adherence to hierarchy that if you don't like the result in the trial court and you have a reasonable claim that there was something procedurally wrong with the case or the way the law was applied, you can bring an appeal. Notice that if you start in state courts you usually have more chances for appeal because most states have two levels of appellate courts and the federal system has one. Appeals courts can refuse to hear appeals and if they do, you're done. One thing to remember, the loser can always try to appeal even if that loser was the state that failed in its and that you may have even heard of. But how does a case get to the Supreme Court, Craig? Well, I will answer that for you. That's my job. Most of the time, the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction. In fact, it's the final court of appeals. If you lose there, you've really, really lost. When the court hears a case, it's called judicial review. There are, however, circumstances when the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction and can act like a trial court. So it's a good thing that most of the justices are, in fact, lawyers, although there's no constitutional requirement that they want to either. I understand. They also can't. And it's not just because most of the justices are kind of old. It's because they're only nine of them and they get requests to review about 8,000 cases a year. Out of these they actually hand down about AD decisions. So they have decision rules to weed out the cases that they don't want to hear. The first one is that there has to be a case or controversy, which means that you can't request the court to review whether or not a law is unconstitutional before it has gone into effect. There has to be an actual injury first. Another way of saying this is that the Supreme Court will not issue advisory opinions, spec handled the issue and not get involved. There are certain cases that the court will almost always take, even though all things being equal they'd rather not. When the circuit courts have reached different or conflicting conclusions on the same issue, what's known as a circuit split, the court will usually hear the case to resolve the confusion. The court will also almost always hear a case where the federal government itself initiated the appeal. Finally, the Supreme Court will usually take a case that has a clear constitutional question, like one involving freedom of speech or religion, although there are sometimes constitutional issues that they feel are settled or they just don't want to deal with.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're gonna get personal. Not personal in the sense that I'm gonna tell you I'm a bedwetter, because I'm not gonna tell you that. We're gonna talk about people's personal political views and where they come from. This way. I'll, conservative clone. But bad, here's why. Sometimes liberals in the US are called New Deal Liberals, because the policies that we support drew out of the New Deal, and lately a number of us are trying to rebrand ourselves as progressives. Although this is a little tricky, given that historically, progressives and liberals aren't the same thing. In the debate over guns or butter, we like butter. Although we're also fine with the government telling us not to eat so much of it, economic self-interest is a prime determiner of where one stands politically. And it also explains why white conservatives, especially those who are wealthy, favor policies of lower taxes and less government intervention. One problem with a liberal viewpoint. Whether or not most teachers and textbooks are liberal, it's a bit of a leap to assume that most students will automatically adopt the ideology of their teachers. Education does relate to political ideology in at least one measurable way, though used all the time in our discussions of American politics. In fact, it would be hard to talk about politics without them. Thanks for watching. See you next time.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're finally going to talk about a topic I know that you've all been waiting for, monetary and fiscal policy. Hooray! You haven't been waiting for monetary and fiscal policy? Are you sure? I've been talking it up for weeks, you supplying actual currency, most of which is kept in highly secure facilities staffed by robots with laser eyes. I don't know if they have laser eyes. The Fed also sets up rules for banks, although these can also be set by Congress. But the most important thing the Fed does is loan money to other banks and set interest rates. That's why when you hear about Reserve also sets the interest rate banks charge to lend money to each other, which again controls the amount of money that circulates. If banks are charging each other a lot of money to borrow, they won't borrow as much, and they won't lend as much to firms and individuals, and there will be less money in the economy as a whole. There's at least one more important way that the Fed influences the money supply in the U.S., and that's through open market operations. This is a fancy way to here that the Federal Reserve is an independent body, meaning that its board of governors and chairperson are not elected or really subject to much regulation from Congress. And they throw the best parties. That's probably why. This is intentional and probably a good idea. Ideally, you want people in charge of the money supply to be able to look after broader interests than their own re-election. And this is why the Fed is supposed to be insulated from politics and remain independent. Okay, so that's monetary policy, which is one lever that the I'm not going to discuss the details of the theory or even whether it's right or wrong or somewhere in between. But the basic thrust is that if you lower taxes than businesses and individuals, the individuals will be able to spend more. The businesses will be able to invest more and the economy as a whole will grow. It's a simple and politically powerful idea and has set the terms of the debate for a generation. In general, over the past 30 years, the trend is for there to be lower federal taxes and for them to be less progressive, meaning that wealthier people pay. There are certain items in the federal budget that must be spent because they're written into law by Congress. These are called uncontrollables or mandatory spending. One uncontrollable that relates to monetary policy is interest payments on federal debt. The government can't not pay its interest, otherwise no one would lend us money. That's just how lending works, or it's supposed to work. Farm price supports, subsidies are also counted as uncontrollables, and they are important, but not nearly as important far the largest chunk of government spending goes into defense, over $600 billion in 2013. But the next largest item is healthcare for the poor, Medicaid, at $498 billion. Nothing else even comes close. Spending on the Department of Education, for example, was $41 billion in 2013. The second thing to bear in mind is that in addition to cutting spending, the government could balance its budget by doing what everyone loves, raising taxes. It's done this on occasion, but the political consequences can be pretty tough. Just ask George H.W. Bush.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to try to wrap up the incredibly fun and uplifting subject of equal protection and discrimination. Because if you thought the 14th Amendment only protected racial and religious minorities and maybe women to some degree, then you've underestimated the power of what I call the most important amendment to the Constitution. Typical lefty nonsense, you haven't even mentioned the Second Amendment, the one that gives us the real power to protect ourselves from government overreach had the effect of discriminating against southern and eastern Europeans, and if you read the newspaper from the time, that was clearly their intent. But they didn't single out any particular group like the Chinese Exclusion Act did. In fact, it was an Asian-American who helped establish that the 14 we should be calling people undocumented or aliens. But I'm going to draw a line and say that a person, no matter how he or she got here, can't be illegal. That just doesn't make sense. Anyway, people who emigrate to the US following immigration rules and regulations generally are entitled to the same rights and privileges as citizens, it makes some sense that the courts would look closely at cases involving immigrants who, for the most part, can't work to change policies by voting. Thanks, Thought Bubble. There's one more ethnic group in the US that gets special treatment in the Constitution, and for good reason, Native Americans. Since they were here long before the framers of the Constitution, they're the only group mentioned by name in the document. Unfortunately, the Constitution itself doesn't actually clarify how they are to be treated, and their legal disabilities. Even trying to describe this group can be tricky because some disabilities, like missing a limb, are pretty much permanent, at least for now, while others are not. Many people are born with an attribute that much of society considers a disability, while others develop them as a result of accident or disease or some other factor. Many people who study disability point out that most of us will become less and less able to function in some way over anti-discrimination statutes. What? And since LGBT people are not usually in the majority, and certainly don't make up a majority population in a state, they couldn't do much to protect themselves. That is until the Supreme Court stepped in and ruled in Romer v. Evans that states couldn't do this anymore. More recently, the Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas ruled that state morality laws that were applied against LGBT people and not against straight people were a violation of equal protection.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to talk about, well, mostly history. Wait, Stan, this isn't Crash Course history. This must be some kind of exception, like the Mongols. Apparently Alexander Hamilton was prominent in both groups. But overall, the Federalists were supported by Northeastern business elites, especially merchants who like the Supreme Court or Native Americans. But from our perspective, he's really useful because his election helped to launch the second party system. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The new party, called the Wigs, started out as an anti-Jackson party. They claimed Jackson was a tyrant, and they might have had a point. The second party system brought innovations to the political process, mostly in the party that opposed the Wigs. The Democratic Republicans re Tyler tip. This came from Harrison's supposed status as the hero of the battle of Tipikanu, which introduced another aspect into American politics. The idea that successful candidates for president should, if at all possible, be war heroes. Thanks Thought Bubble. Eventually the issue of slavery pretty much destroyed the Whig party and the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 ushered in the third party system. Lincoln ran and won as a Republican and after was the era of political machines, which traded political appointments for support to win elections and maintain power. Most famous of these machines tended to be in big cities with large immigrant populations like Boston and New York, and they were mostly Democratic, although there were Republican political machines too, mostly in the Midwest. The supposed Democratic abuses of machines the establishment candidate Taft and former President Theodore Roosevelt, who started his own progressive party. The rise and fall of the populace shows us something important about third parties in American politics. The first thing is that they never win, largely because of the way American elections are structured. But this doesn't mean that they don't matter. Third parties can shift the terms of political debate. Without a socialist party, and there was one, believe it or not, issues of workers' rights wouldn't have been nearly as prevalent in the early backbone of the Democrats, were attracted by New Deal farm policies. New Deal support for jobs and FDR's repeal of prohibition helped bring urban immigrants, especially Catholics, into the Democrats' camp. Democrats' acknowledgement that African Americans were suffering, especially hard from the Depression, helped shift African American support away from the party of Lincoln. This was a major realignment, as black people, when they could vote in America, had until the New Deal voted overwhelmingly for Republicans. And even though New we can say is that for whatever reason, the Republican Party now draws a lot of support from white, middle, and lower-middle-class voters, especially in the South and Midwest, and that these were groups that used to vote for Democrats. A major part of this realignment is white working-class men, who generally used to be reliable union Democrats, but are now just as likely to vote Republican. The Democrats have maintained their support among liberal intellectuals, members of minority groups, and to a lesser degree women, but their coalition is much less powerful than it used to be. We could say a lot more about political parties in America and how they might be changing as we speak, but as I promise,\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to finish up our discussion of the First Amendment finally by talking about everybody's favorite, the press. The First Amendment is pretty clear that Congress can't make any laws abridging the freedom of the press and since you understand the basics of free speech because you were paying attention, the reasons for this should make a lot of sense. But as with any discussion of the First Amendment, things aren't as straightforward it, they would be punished for contempt of court. Instead, the newspaper countersued, claiming that Minneapolis and Minnesota were violating their freedom of the press. The Supreme Court agreed that no government was allowed to censor the press because a free press is essential for the political system to work. They based their decision on a lot of history, including Blackstone, the British legal authority, which explained, There's a right for themselves. Unflattering publicity might simply be considered the price of fame. I'd point out that celebrities are human too, except for Lil Bub, the only non-human celebrity, and probably don't like being liable. I guess Jar go with untrue. The government tried to stop the times and the Washington Post too, from publishing these papers because it would make the government look bad and perhaps turn public opinion against the war. Now this was 1971, and a good deal of public opinion was kind of already against the war, so much so that Lyndon Johnson had decided not to run for re-election just a few years before in 1968. But the government said that publication of this classified report would cause irreparable harm to America's ability to defend itself, and they tried to stop the publication.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're finally at long last moving on from the structures and branches of government and on to the structures and branches of trees. This is a nature show now. Okay, we're not moving on completely because we're still talking about courts, but today we'll be discussing actual court decisions and the kinds of things that courts rule on rather than how they inequality in the way that the laws work. Now just to make things more confusing, lawyers often talk about the difference between substantive and procedural liberties, but they usually call them rights instead of liberties. It's a lawyer eagle. A legal eagle. Substantive liberties are limits on what the government can do. For example, the First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law establishing religion. So this means that they cannot create a national church or declare that Christianity free exercise thereof or bridging the freedom of speech or of the press or to assemble or to infringe the right to petition the government for address of grievances pretty straightforward but other cases are not so clear the second amendment says the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed but it doesn't say by whom same thing with the Fifth Amendment guarantees against self-incrimination could Congress were added to the Constitution. Of these, the 14th is the most important, probably the most important of all amendments. What does it say? Well, the first section, which is the one that really matters, and I'm not going to read the Supreme Court, which by now has incorporated almost every clause in the Bill of Rights against the states. In one example, we got them. In the famous case of Gitlow v. New York, the court ruled that the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech could not be violated by a state. In this case, it was New York, but once the liberties incorporated against one state, it's incorporated against all of them. In Matt v. Ohio, the court ruled that states couldn't use evidence gathered from warrantless searches. In Benton v. Maryland, the right against double jeopardy, being tried for to addressing this issue of states denying people's liberties. Even then, it took numerous court cases for us to get to the point that most of the liberties that we assume cannot be taken away by the government have actually been guaranteed through the process of selective incorporation. It's taken a long time to get where we are, and there's still a long way to go. Protecting civil liberties requires vigilant citizens to be aware of the ways their government is overstepping its bounds, but that's only half the equation. It's also vital that our majority pay attention to the civil rights of others, and that we ensure that everyone has afforded the same protections and benefits promised by\", 'Politics'], [\" Hey, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today I'm going to cut through the red tape with common sense reforms to get our government back on track. Actually, no, we're not going to do any of those things. Although if you pay attention to American politics, you may have heard that bureaucracies are a problem and that they're strangling American innovation and that they must be dealt with and soon. Part of the reason you may have heard this is that Americans just seem to hate bureaucracies for reasons I've mentioned and probably one that I haven't. Federal bureaucracies are funded Congress didn't want NASA to search for extraterrestrial life, they could have written it into the law establishing NASA in the first place. A more realistic example is that Congress frequently forbids agencies from funding or even discussing abortions or abortion counseling. This type of bureaucratic control is called procedural. One of the main procedural controls on bureaucracies are reporting requirements, which are forms that agencies have to send back to other oversight agencies detailing what the original agencies actually did. This is where our watchdog organization that checks on how bureaucracies are spending their money, the general accounting office. Congress can also institute investigations, which are less public than hearings, and result in a report. A report. We all hate doing reports, right? The Education? More common than termination is deregulation, which is when Congress limits the number of regulations that an agency is allowed to enforce. Often the thought behind this is that market forces will step in and keep whatever the agency had been regulating under control. But often it doesn't work out as we or Congress might expect. In the 1970s Congress deregulated the airline industry, and one result has been much cheaper airfarers, less popular than bureaucracies or Congress. Another example has been handing out some of the jobs that had previously been done by the army to private military contractors. Privatization looks great politically, to some, and it gives the appearance of shrinking the size of the bureaucracy because employees are off the government's books, but they still have to be paid, so whether privatization actually works out of politics. But in case you haven't noticed, you can't really separate politics and government. But we'll talk about politics in another episode. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.

Craig, we've been talking about government for 13 weeks. To that I say, you got me. But let's talk about actual governing. In particular, the executive branch tools and strategies that the president uses to try to get things done. I mean, the president's just one person. For versions, we don't see much of the White House staff, except for the press secretary, who's the public spokesperson for the president. And maybe the chief of staff can be a public figure as well. Next, in terms of proximity to the president, an influence on his decisions is the executive office of the president. It's staffed by various advisors and policy experts. They're selected by the president and his office, rather than by rising through the ranks of government employment. Or they're chosen for political reasons, like many Postal Service. These agencies are the tools the government has to make policy and to implement it. They are the heart and soul of actual governing, but they aren't all that fun, especially when you look at what strategies the president uses to actually govern. Political scientists will tell you, and I'm not going to argue with them, they're scientists. They went to college. That the president has three main strategies at his disposal. Party leadership, mobilizing public opinion, and administrative strategies. One of these is much more important than the other two. Which one is it? Can you guess? Which one? It's not party leadership, but the president is the leader of his political party, and can use it to like a big policy stick, but it has a downside. Basically, it's not really going to work if the president isn't popular. And his approval rating almost always declines the longer he's in office. This leaves the third tool that the president can use to get things done. Administrative strategy. Yes, that's the most important one. Using administrative agencies to make and carry out policies. Who, ha, yeah, let's go to the Thought Bubble. There are a number of ways that the president can use his administrative offices to bring about the objectives he wants. Over time, the president has expanded White House's interpretation of what the law means and they become part of the legislative history that courts can use if the laws are challenged. Although it's not clear that they have any real legal weight and they might violate separation of powers because courts are supposed to decide what a law means, not the president. The most important administrative strategy that the president has at his disposal is the executive order. These are presidential directives that have the force of law and presidents have used them for major policies that would have been difficult to get through Congress. Thanks, Thought Bubble. When I say that executive action has been used maybe Captain America as well, but he's fictional. Of course, this could potentially give him an incentive to create emergencies and further increase his power. But how about let's not get cynical. Okay. The second argument holds that the president's more able to act in the public interest because he's the center of public attention and thus easily held accountable. And because he only has to run for re-election once. The third argument in favor of a powerful president is that he's the only nationally elected official and thus the most democratic one. The only nationally elected official? Really? What about, uh... Oh yeah.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today I'm going to talk about an aspect of American politics that is probably most familiar to you, at least if you're an American and you sometimes watch TV or look at the internet or read a newspaper or breathe there. I'm talking about elections which get a lot of attention here in the US and on Crash Course, possibly because they present a relatively straightforward narrative that is easy for the media to cover. But we're not going to focus on media coverage today. No, instead we're a choice, but do not necessarily have all the information we need to make that choice. Kind of like when you buy a used car. Elections help to solve this problem because they are ideally competitive. The competition creates incentives for candidates to provide information about themselves and to make most of that information accurate, since their opponent will call them out for any statements that are less than truthful. At least that's what we hope will happen. Elections also supposedly make candidates more accountable, since they provide voters a chance to get rid of bad actors. Of course Constitution was later changed to allow for direct election of senators with the 17th Amendment, so that last clause doesn't matter so much anymore. The Constitution does say more about the way the President is chosen indirectly through the Electoral College, but the framers messed that up so badly that they had to amend the Constitution after the election of 1800. The 12th Amendment, which basically means that the President and Vice President come from the same political party, although it doesn't actually say that, fixed the states. State laws define how candidates are nominated and get on the ballot, and they can influence the operation of political parties. State laws also determine registration requirements for voting, and set up the location in hours of polling places, which vary a lot from state to state. Probably most important for federal elections states decide the boundaries of congressional election districts, although not the number of representatives each state has, which is determined by the state's population. We'll talk more about election districts, 30% And it has one key result for America's political system. It pretty much ensures that we will have only two viable political parties. The concept that plurality rules create two-party systems is explained by something called divergees law. Here's how it works. Imagine political parties on a continuum from extreme right to extreme left. Most voters will not fall into either extreme, so the masses of party followers will coalesce around the center right and center left. In these conditions, there's no incentive to form a third party because it's likely to take votes away from the centrist party and thus throw the election to the other party. Let's say that you're on the kind of thing that political scientists really, really like. We'll look closely at the actual political parties and at who votes for which one in other episodes. But I hope we've provided a little bit of insight into how elections work in the US. Thanks for watching. See you next time.

You can see that it refers directly to states and that it says they can't deprive a person of life, kill them, liberty, lock them up, or property, find them and take away their stuff without due process of law. But what does it mean? Serious fans of jurisprudence, and you know who you are, know that there are two concepts of due process floating around out there. The first is substantive due process, which is a shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. Notice that the second to last clause mentions due process of law and language similar to what you will find in the 14th Amendment. Imagine that. And the rest of the amendment basically explains a lot of what due process is. Let's go to the thought bubble. The first clause basically says that if you are charged with a crime, you are entitled to a freeway through your front yard, they can do it, but they have to pay you for it. This is the basis for what's called eminent domain, which is fascinating, but I don't have time to go into it here. I'm a busy man. Thanks Thought Bubble. So you can see that the Fifth Amendment goes a long way toward protecting us from the state using its power to put us in jail arbitrarily. Just right to a jury of your peers, not a jury of policemen or government officials or people who are basically likely to convict you, although you can waive your right to a jury. And the trial is supposed to be where you committed the crime, although this doesn't always apply exactly. You have the right to know what you are charged with, which makes total sense because if you didn't, it would be pretty hard to put up a good defense and you must be able to cross-examine the witnesses brought against you. Probably most important, yourself and your right to an attorney provided by the state if you can't afford one. Again, because if you have been arrested, you're going to need one. If you're going to take away one thing from this case, don't make it my wallet because that will get you arrested. It should be this. If the police take you into custody or even want to ask you a few questions, you should ask them if you're under arrest. If they say no, then you can walk away from them. If they say yes, you are under arrest, the very next thing you should say is I'd like to speak with a lawyer and don't say anything else to them until you have a lawyer there.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to look at the Supreme Court from a different angle. We're going to try to get inside the justices' heads. Not literally, obviously, but we're going to look at the factors that influence the way they decide cases other than the structure of the court system. So we're pretty far away from the Constitution here and, so the president isn't much of a factor. Much more influential on justices is history, which works in two ways. First, the principles of precedent and starry decisis constrain the possible decisions that justices can make. Second, and more historical in the sense we think of history about the court, are judicial activism and judicial restraint. Let's not show any restraint in actively going to the Thought Bubble right now. Judicial activism is the idea that the court should act as an instrument of policy, making it much more like the other two branches of government. Judicial activists tend to look beyond the mid-70s, when Earl Warren and Warren Burger were the chief justices. During this time, the court made important decisions, expanding civil rights, voting rights, the right to privacy, and the rights of people accused of crimes. From the 1980s through the early 2000s, the court led by William Rankquist was known for its judicial restraint, dialing back civil rights, affirmative action, and desegregation programs, and attempting to reign in Democrat, believes that judicial change should be incremental and doesn't want to make decisions that will cause sweeping changes. So he's exercising judicial restraint. So I'm going to stop here otherwise we're going to fall into the trap of talking politics. And I don't want to do that with him around because he's always trying to sue American Eagle Apparel for violating his right of publicity. And I think it's fine. They've had that trademark for quite some time. I'm sorry, but you don't really have those rights.

Now if you've been watching these episodes and reading the comments you might be thinking that we've been trying to avoid the issue of money in politics and the role of special interests in the US political system we have. If you are one of those people that wants to talk about money in politics this episode will not disappoint you. I'm kidding, I know to focus on a particular branch of government, and I'll give you three guesses which one. No, not the Supreme Court, even though with only nine members, it would be the most efficient way for an interest group to exert pressure. Punching is the most efficient way for me to exert pressure onto an eagle. And not the executive branch, because if you remember, the president has lots of professional people to advise him, and since he can only serve two terms, he's less susceptible to pressure that way. That leaves Congress. Which is the answer. That's where the interest groups exert their pressure. In fact, the practice of interest groups writing bills for state legislators is depressingly common. Given that congressmen are pretty busy trying to get reelected, it's not surprising that they would be grateful for information from interest groups. But what about bureaucracies? They're supposed to be made up of experts and they don't have to run for re-election, right? Well, they are, and they don't. But information is really, really costly, and often bureaucratic agencies are just not as well funded as an interest group. The oil industry is represented by the organization that collects and distributes campaign funds and information, and therefore is concerned with elections. Interest groups can give money to PACS and they can even form their own PACS, but they aren't exactly the same thing. Okay, so now the controversial issue with interest groups. Do they have too much influence? To sort this out, I'm gonna need some help from some friends, and by friends, I mean clones, which aren't my friends. Let's head to the clone zone. Okay, here we are! Clone zone! It's just like the regular zone, except that thing's or at least it's supposed to. By joining an interest group, an individual can push for a policy they care about all the time, not just at election time, and isn't participation the essence of democracy? I think no. Thanks you beautiful clones. So there you have the basics of interest groups in America and why they're so controversial. I hope that you now have a better understanding of what interest groups are and what they are\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and I'm excited. I'm excited because today we start delving into Supreme Court jurisprudence with the totally non-controversial topic of freedom of religion. Now, other than being fun to say jurisprudence means all the important cases on a particular topic, but unfortunately I'm only going to be talking about a couple of them because they demonstrate how the Supreme Court reasons a way, is more straightforward. It means you can't pay for exercise. Gym memberships are illegal. But freedom isn't free. You're gonna pay with pain. No pain, no gain. Actually, none of that is what we're talking about. What it means is you can't be prohibited from being part of a certain religion, although it doesn't mean that any religious practice is okay. For example, if your religion requires human sacrifice because you're an Aztec, state, local, and federal law could prevent you from law's principle or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion. Here again, the court found that paying private school teachers or using private this situation the secular purpose was a good one, there's a tendency for states to take more and more power for themselves. But my bigger concern is that all three prongs in this case were given equal weight, and I'm not sure that they always should be. I mean, you got the one round one and then the two like for analyzing future situations where religion and the state might get mixed up. It's probably better than having what legal scholars like to call a bright line rule about religion in public spaces, like schools and courthouses. But it does leave a lot of wiggle room, and it seems that it encourages future cases because we keep seeing them.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today, finally, we are stepping into the big leagues. That's right, I'm trying out for the Cubs. No, we're going to talk about how the Supreme Court of the United States actually works. I could try it for the Cubs, right Stan? Sometimes people refer to it by the unfortunate nickname SCOTUS, but I'm not going to do it. I'm going to call it the Supreme Coco or Coco Supreme. club, if you're old enough to get into a hot club. They screen out a lot of petitions because those cases don't raise a lot of federal law questions or because they've already been decided in other cases. Or they're not wearing good enough shoes to get in the club. If, and it's a big if, your petition is two. But often there are many, many more briefs, and even boxer briefs. That's writing the court's decision, called the majority opinion. The opinions are given in writing, although sometimes justices will read them from the bench. Sometimes the court will issue a single majority opinion, which is a very strong statement of unified agreement. In the key civil rights case of Brown versus Board of Education, the court issued a single opinion that was even stronger because it was unanimous. But sometimes the court will issue multiple opinions on the same case. The decision of the court, either to affirm or overturn the lower court's ruling, as with the famously bad case of Plessy versus Ferguson, the arguments in a dissent can form the foundation for the majority opinion in a later case, even though it can take 50 years to get from a case like Plessy to Brown versus Board of Education. So that's the nuts and bolts of how Supreme Court decisions are made. But before we wrap this up, here are a few key things to remember. First, there are a lot of hurdles you need to jump over before a court makes a decision in a case. Most certiorari petitions, there are usually about 8,000 each year, don't make it past a clock\", 'Politics'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace. Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to look at why Congress acts the way it does. More specifically, we're going to try to figure out as much as we can without being mind readers the factors that influence congressmen when they make decisions. Then after that we'll be mind readers and then we'll see if we were right. This should be why congressmen tend to spend much more time in their home states and districts than in Washington. They might also want to check up on their lawn the writing of bills. Interest groups are most influential at the committee stage of legislation, rather than when congressmen are casting floor votes and their influence tends to be mostly negative. This means that rather than inserting items into legislation, it's much easier and more effective sure you're aware of that. The president has the most power when his party and the majority party in Congress are the same. When this happens, Congress and maybe congressional history, but since this is a broad survey of American government and politics, we can't easily get into that without taking less breaks. I'm going to go on break.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to begin our discussion of politics rather than government. Aren't they the same thing, Stan? Aren't they that they're not the same? Oh, I know some of you are saying that we've been talking about politics all along and in a sense that's true, but for the rest of the series we'll be looking more closely at policies and the factors that influence how they're made rather than the institutions and structures that make them. One way to think about this is that government describes the what, which classicists out there will know comes from the Greek word, Demacresia, which means ruled by the people. It's not a drug for balding men. That's something else. And as anyone who's been forced to learn the Gettysburg Address knows, like Abraham Lincoln, America's is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. So what the people think, especially about how the government should govern, matters. But it also raises some important questions. Namely, how do the people express what they want? How does, or should, the authors concluded, most people don't have real opinions at all. Wow, I have no opinion about that. Oh, and if you're thinking, well, that's fine, but in 1960, America's had so much less information available to them. They didn't even have color then, and everyone wore hats. Everyone wore hats then. Today we have the Internet's in 24-hour TV news, but here's a statistic. In 1960, 47% of people were unable to name the member should be able to communicate what they want to government officials. And third, the government should pay attention to the public's desires and respond accordingly. All three of these conditions can provide interesting problems of their own. Even if you agree with the rational public idea and assume that the population as a whole does have coherent political views, the chances are good that what the public wants consists mostly of generalities and are difficult to turn into actual policies. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis was solidly against a plan to bail out Mexico with a multi-billion dollar loan. But Clinton pushed through an executive order making the loan anyway because his advisor said this was good economic policy. More often, politicians use public opinion polling to shape the responses to issues. Rather than defining the issue for the politicians, the polls are used to help them craft a message that will be more acceptable to the public. And public opinion polling certainly has a role in setting the policy agenda by informing politicians of the issues that's too small may suffer from a sampling error. You can sometimes deduce the size of a poll sample from its margin of error. A poll with a small sample will have a large margin of error. In general, for national public opinion polls, the margin of error will be plus or minus three points. This means that if the poll says that 53% of people support Policy X, it's better to say that between 50 and 56% of respondents supported it. But that's just a little math. For fun! Polling organizations like Harris, Pugh, and Galluperve on, which implies that I don't go out. I haven't gone out since 2003.\", 'Politics'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace. The Constitution says right here in the text that the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Navy. This also implies that he can and perhaps will lead the armed forces when the nation is at war. It also implies that he can command the Air Force even though it only mentions the Army and Navy. So far so good, but what about when the nation is not technically at war? Remember that the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war as a check on presidential power. But the President still has the inherent power to use troops even when Congress hasn't actually formally declared war. Logically, if there's an immediate threat to the US and Congress doesn't have the time or the opportunity to declare war, the Commander-in-Chief must be able to being authorized. appointments shape the political agenda. But more importantly, in appointing the ministers, the president assumes an inherent power to direct them and their agencies on how to implement laws. This makes sense. As anyone who's ever worked for a boss knows, once you're hired, you're sort of expected to know what your boss wants and to do it. This power to direct agencies on how to execute laws is enormous. It basically directs the way the government acts. The president has pretty limited formal powers over Congress. Other than convening special sessions in the veto and the state of the union address, maybe, he can't do all that much to influence them. I mean, Congress usually meets without the president telling them is probably the most important one. He can give executive orders. These are presidential directives or rules that have the force of law. Executive orders can be overturned by actual congressional lawmaking or by Supreme Court decisions. These executive orders allow the president to circumvent the legislative process and act unilaterally. Ideally, the president and Congress should work together. But come on. Sometimes the president decides to go it alone. Because they don't work together that often. These days, anyway.

We're going to talk about when the police are allowed to search your house, your car, and even you. But not me. I have immunity. I'm on YouTube. Right? Is a piece of paper issued by a judge authorizing law enforcement officers to search something, usually your house, but possibly your car, or your person, or your desk eagle. I'm not hiding anything in there. But according to the Fourth Amendment, for the police to get a judge to issue a warrant, they must have probable cause, which's pretty obvious. But many times it isn't. For example, if the warrant allows the police to search your kitchen for illegal hand grenades and they look in your freezer and find illegal drugs instead, that's probably reasonable because freezers are where most people store their illegal hand grenades and also their drugs. And if the police stop you for speeding, which is a violation of traffic laws, also known as a crime, and then search your car and find a dead body in the trunk, the courts have ruled that this evidence, and any evidence seized pursuant to an illegal search, cannot be used against a defendant in a trial. This is called an exclusionary rule. Unlawfully obtained evidence is excluded from the trial, and it's sometimes called the fruit of the poison tree, possibly because lawyers are better at naming things than historians are. This have ruled that students don't have the same protections as other citizens and that the interests of the state in keeping a safe drug and a weapon-free educational environment trumps their privacy interests. Although there are limits to how intrusive these searches to be determined by the courts. In this case, as with most civil liberties cases, the courts attempt to balance an individual's interest in maintaining her privacy against the state's interest in preventing crime and keeping citizens safe. It's not an easy balance, but that's what makes the issue complex and interesting. At least to us here at Crash Course, because we're complex and interesting. Right Stan? Thanks for watching.

Okay, maybe that's a little unfair, but the workings of Congress are kind of arcane, or Byzantine, or maybe let's just say extremely complex and confusing. Like me, or Game of Thrones, without the nudity. Some of the nudity, maybe. However, Congress is the most important branch, so it would probably Global Warming has only advisory authority, which tells you pretty much all you need to know about Congress and climate change. There are joint committees made up of members of both houses.

Like that one. And that one. And ooh, that one's my favorite. Other committees are conference committees, which are created to reconcile a bill when the House and Senate write different versions of it system. Let's talk about how committees actually work in the Thought Bubble. Any member of Congress can propose a bill. This is called proposal power, but it has to go to a committee first. Then to get to the rest of the House or Senate, it has to be reported out of committee. The chair determines the agenda by choosing which issues get considered. In the House, the Speaker refers bills to particular committees, but the ones that have bent the Congress into its current shape occurred under the speakership of Newt Gingrich in 1994. Overall, Gingrich increased the power of the speaker, who was already pretty powerful. The number of subcommittees was reduced, and seniority rules in appointing chairs were changed.

As congresspeople spend more and more time raising money, more and more of the actual legislative work is done by staff. In addition to the individual staffers, congress as a whole has specialized staff agencies that are supposed to be more independent. You may have heard of these agencies, or at least some of them. The Congressional Research Service is supposed to perform unbiased factual research for congresspeople and their staff to help them in the process of writing the actual to look nice.\", 'Politics'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace. Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today I've got my work cut out for me because I'm going to try to do something that every single social studies teacher in the US has tried to do even though there's a perfectly good cartoon you could just show. It's from the 70s. It's catchy. It's fun. That's right. Today we're going to learn how a bill becomes a law but we're not going to be able to license the schoolhouse rock song. I'm just a bill. Yes, and vote on it. If the markup wins a majority in the committee, it moves to the floor of the full Senate for consideration. The Senate decides the rules for debate, how long the debate will go on and whether or not there will be amendments. An open rule allows for amendments and a closed rule does not. Open rules make it much less likely for bills to pass because opponents of the bill can add clauses that will make it hard for the bill's proponents to vote for. If opponents of our helicopter name bill were to add a clause repealing the Affordable Care Act or something, some supporters of the bill probably wouldn't vote for it. If a bill wins the majority of votes in the President's signs the bill, boom, done. That's the only option. Oh, no, there's two other options. Actually. Option two is for him to veto the bill, and we've gone through all of this for nothing. The third option is only available at the end of a congressional term. the murderous hands of the speaker, or majority leader, who refuses to refer it to committee. Then the committee can kill the bill by not voting for it at all. And if they do vote, and it doesn't get a majority, then the bill doesn't of all the post office that aren't named. You can't think of one, can you? Name it. You can't. It's not named. Vito gates are purely procedural, which means they don't draw a lot of attention from the media. The easiest way for Congress to kill bills is to simply not vote on them, or even schedule votes for them. This way they don't have to go on record as being for or against a bill, just whether they support having a vote. And constituents rarely check up on this sort of thing. So I hope I managed to do a good job of both explaining how a bill becomes a law and why it's difficult for most bills to pass. And I hope I looked good doing it.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to turn to a topic that is near and dear to our wallets at Crash Course Economics. Now I know that dedicated fans are saying, hold on, Craigers, you have a whole series about economics. Tell me about government. To those fans I say, you're right. And don't call me Craigers. But this episode's going to be about the role that government plays in the economy, specifically the way that government creates and maintains a market economy by establishing law and order, defining rules of property, governing rules of exchange, setting market standards, providing public goods, creating a labor force, ameliorating externalities, and promoting competition. I think most of us can agree that a big part of government's job is to establish law and order. This idea goes back at least as far as the enlightenment and Thomas Hobbes, but since this isn't Crash Course Political Philosophy, I'm gonna move on. Law and order helps to structure We don't actually receive written titles when we buy most things, but according to the law, if I can establish ownership by proving I paid for this shirt or somebody left it to me in their will or something, then it's mine and if someone takes it from me, I can bring the law down on them. The courts, the legal system, or maybe the sheriff will help me get it back. A really concrete example of the way the laws create and protect property rights are trespass laws, which allow you to tell those noisy kids or from selling your body through prostitution, or selling parts of your body like your kidneys. Some economists may question the wisdom of these rules, but they exist, and by making and enforcing them, the government can exert powerful control over what can and cannot be exchanged. Thanks Thought Bubble! Probably less controversial than the rules governing exchange is the government's role in setting market standards. This is something governments have been doing for a very long time, and you've probably learned New York subway recently, it doesn't always seem like a subsidy is big enough. In many cases, the government steps in to provide public goods when markets wouldn't. It's not likely that private companies would provide an air traffic control system, and even if they did, it would have to be highly regulated by the government anyway. Because you don't want different cities and states enacting different rules about air travel. That would be a literal disaster. Also, if it were up to unregulated markets, there wouldn't be any affordable flights to places why college is so easy to pay for now. Right? Wink. There are government-run training programs, and I suppose the potential for the government to employ more people, like it did during the Great Depression, with programs like the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. Now, if you allow me to put on my Economist hat, Stan, do we have budget for an Economist hat? No. Apparently, economists wear very expensive market economy, at least the last way I'm going to talk about, is by promoting competition. According to our old friend, Adam Smith, the essence of a functioning market system is competition, and in a perfect world, competition would ensure that people got the best products at the best prices. But history has shown that corporations and individuals have often tried to stifle competition and create monopolies. If there's only one firm selling a product, that firm can charge whatever it wants. And this monopoly condition doesn't usually benefit consumers, at least not as much as it benefits monopolists.\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to talk about a fundamental concept in American government federalism. Sorry, I'm not sorry. You're not even endangered anymore. Federalism is a little confusing because it includes the word federal as in federal government, which is what we use to describe the government of the United States as a whole, which is kind of the opposite of what we mean when we say federalism. Confused? Google it. For one thing, there are some aspects of government that are handled by both the state and the national government. Taxes. Americans' favorite government activity are an example. There are federal taxes and state taxes. But it gets even more complicated because there are different types of federal and divorce. Morality, stuff like public lewdness and drinking, keeps me in check. Public health, education, criminal laws, including determining what is a crime and how crimes are prosecuted, land use, which includes water and mineral rights, elections, there was very little regulation of business at all. FREEDOM! And this is how things stood, with the US following a system of dual federalism with very little government regulation and the national government not doing much other than going to war, buying or conquering enormous amounts of territory and delivering the mail. Then the Great Depression happened, and Franklin Roosevelt and Congress enacted the New Deal, which changed the role of the federal government in a big poor. The more poor people a state had, the more money it got. Project grants require states to submit proposals in order to receive aid. The states compete for a limited pool of resources. Nowadays, project grants are more common than formula grants, but neither is as popular as block grants, which the government gives out Lego blocks, and then you build stuff with the Legos. It's a good time. No, no, where the national government gives a state a huge chunk of money for something big like infrastructure, and Congress tried to do something about them with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, or UMRA, but it hasn't really worked. In the early 21st century, Americans are basically living under a system of cooperative federalism, with some areas of activity that are heavily regulated. This is a stretch from the original idea that federalism will keep the national government small and have most government functions belong to the states. If you follow American politics, and I know you do, this small government ideal should sound of a break on the commerce clause. So, as you can see, where we are with federalism today is kind of complicated. Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton seemed to favor new federalism and block grants. But George W. Bush seemed to push back towards regulated federalism with laws like no child left behind in the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. It's pretty safe to say that we're going to continue to live under a regime of cooperative federalism with a healthy dose of regulation thrown in. But many Americans feel that the national government is too big and expensive and not with the framers'\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig.

The outcome of an election might affect your life more than the outcome of a sports game, though. Unless you're gambling. Which might be illegal. Government is really important.

WOO! Yeah to form groups that will vote in certain ways. Here's an example, albeit one that overgeneralizes a little bit. Just, just come on, just go with it. In general, Republican candidates support policies that are more friendly to business. So if you're a businessman, you know that affiliating yourself with the Republican Party is probably going to benefit you. The second reason given for forming political parties is that they facilitate do they do? Well, they have five main functions in the US, and I'll leave it up to you to decide which, if any, is the most important. Eagle doesn't get to decide. Eagle doesn't get to decide anything. So here's the list. One, recruit candidates. Two, nominate candidates. Three, get out the vote. Four, facilitate electoral choice. Five, influence national government. ways that a candidate for president can be nominated. In the old days, presidential candidates were nominated at a convention, or caucus, which are gatherings of party members governed by rules. Conventions still occur every four years, but they're largely ceremonial these days because presidential candidates are actually nominated during the primaries. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Primary elections are held to choose candidates who will then run in the later general election. Political parties decide when and how primaries will be held and nominate the candidates at the convention. The delegates are usually pledged to vote for the candidate who won the primary in their state, at least on the first ballot, and majority rules in nominating. This is why we see so much election coverage of primaries and why some states like New Hampshire try so hard to have their primaries early. Once a candidate has sewn up enough delegates, he or she becomes the nominee, and the convention serves largely as a formality. Although the primary system is more democratic than the convention, it still has problems. Even though there's do is mobilize voters, also known as getting out the vote. This is pretty obvious because you can't elect a candidate if you don't get people out to vote for them. Duh! Parties get out the vote through direct mail, email, and advertisements, and they can also help with voter registration drives. The main thing the party does in terms of getting out the vote is coordinate volunteers to help encourage voting. If you want to help on a campaign or with an election effort, your local party office is a good place to start. Another good place to start is getting out of bed. Getting out, getting who the chairs of the committees are. And they, along with his speaker and the majority leader in the Senate, largely shape Congress's agenda. The President and his party have a reciprocal relationship. That's the best kind of relationship. And the most fun to say. Reciprocal. The President is the leader of his party, and his personal character and popularity helps to shape the party's brand, for better or worse, and can be used to raise money. On the other side, the party throws its support behind the President's initiatives and helps to elect candidates that support him in Congress. So at their most basic level, parties exist to elect political candidates\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today I'm going to get inside the head of the American voter and then we are going to win every election ever. No, not literally. That would require some sort of shrink-ray technology that hasn't been invented. Although I understand there is an Ant-Man movie. Today we're going to look at how voters make decisions and when it comes right down to it, we don't really know. After all, voting is like any other decision. It results from a number of factors only some of episode. Really we're gonna discuss makeup? Stan? Oh. Okay. For now we should acknowledge that party loyalty is very very important in predicting voter behavior. In fact, it is usually in the range of 90%. People identify with a political party for a number of reasons. Some develop a psychological attachment to their party, often from youth. I've mentioned this before, but your parents can have a powerful effect on whether you identify as a candidates with characteristics that they like. Which characteristics seem to matter? Well, have graduated from college, but only about 30% of Americans have. Many voters are also influenced by a candidate's personality. These include virtues like a reputation for honesty, energy, and decisiveness. But maybe all candidates are decisive, and that's why they it to be basically infrared because they don't want any of it at all. Abortion is sometimes considered a spatial issue as well, although there are probably fewer points on the continuum for it, or if the issues line up in their favor. One thing that political scientists have discovered is that the more informed the electorate is, the more heavily issues and candidate characteristics matter. But since, as we've seen, Americans are generally not well-informed voters. Party affiliation looms particularly large in American campaigns, and that's what we'll be looking at next time. Campaigns.

There's a few things I'm not going to do in this episode though. First, I'm not going to try to defend all aspects of affirmative action. I admit it to these two things. And that's why they are the focus of affirmative action efforts. Here's where it gets tricky. In order to increase access to education and job opportunities for members of groups that are historically discriminated against, affirmative action programs try to ensure that they get extra Baki's favor, saying that racial quotas were not allowed since they didn't provide equal opportunity. But they also ruled that affirmative action programs were allowed if they served a compelling government interest and were narrowly tailored to meet that interest. In other words, if they passed the test of strict scrutiny. One of the more interesting things about this decision is the kind of stuff the courts said constitutes a compelling government interest. They rejected the idea that writing historical wrongs was something that the struck down affirmative action provisions because they fail one or another of the strict scrutiny tests. But the basic idea that universities can create programs to build and maintain a diverse student body has been upheld. Two relatively recent cases involving the University of Michigan show how complicated it can be. In the 2003 case of Gratz v. Bollinger, the court ruled that Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, which, also known as the California Civil Rights Initiative, passed over vocal and organized opposition, the graduation rate among African Americans in some California universities went up. On the other hand, the enrollment rate of African Americans at many UC schools declined, and it only returned to 1996 levels in 2010. Other states like Michigan have passed laws similar to California's Proposition 209, making it harder and harder for affirmative action programs to flourish. But as is often the case in politics, people's response to affirmative action\", 'Politics'], [\" Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government in Politics and today we're going to talk about the single most important document in America, one that we'll be talking about a lot over the next few didn't like. All decisions were collective, which meant that very few decisions were actually made, because it's really hard to get 13 people to agree on something that will be in the interest of all 13 between different states. More specifically, the states with large populations and the smaller states. Basically, a state with a large population, like say, Virginia, had different needs than a state with a small population like Delaware. More importantly, large states might stand to benefit more from any government spending. When the delegates decided to make a new Congress, these large population states wanted the number of representatives to that Congress to be proportional to the state's populations, which would mean that the larger states would have more representatives than the smaller ones. This idea with large slave populations like South Carolina and Virginia had a pretty big interest in counting these slaves for the purposes of determining representation. And the states with few slaves didn't want them counted at all, because this would mean that the white non-slave people in those states with lots of slaves would effectively be better represented than the white non-slave people in the states with few slaves. The delegates at the Constitutional Convention solved this problem with another compromise that was decidedly less great. Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. So before this Constitution of compromise could go into effect, it had to be ratified by at least nine of the 13 states. So each state had a special convention where delegates could vote on whether or not to adopt the new Constitution. These conventions were more open to the public than the Constitutional Convention itself, and the ratification process is the reason why some people say the Constitution is based on the will of the people. But not everybody wanted the Constitution, and they needed convincing. This is where things get a little confusing. Did you want the Constitution a good trading partner. Given the rage and success of the article's government, it yet another example of how different interests had to give a little in order to get a Constitution passed. It's very important to remember that compromise, the idea of balancing interests and giving a little to get a lot, is embedded in the Constitution. While today it seems like a political dirty word, compromise is the basis of the American government itself. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week. Well, I'll compromise, see you in a week and a half.

No Stan that Youngstown sheet and tube company versus Sawyer. Although that is one of my favorites. Loves me some sheet and tube. And no it's not Ex Parte Quirin, although I do love me the Supreme Court does this a lot, but it doesn't, and historically, it almost never happened before the 20th century. If the court were always striking down congressional statutes, it would be hard for people to know which laws to follow, and you'll remember one of the main things that courts do is create expectations and predictability. executive, although you might think that it should. The fourth area where the court exercises judicial review is over presidential actions. The court tends to defer to the president, especially in the area of national security. The classic example of the court overturning the executive action happened in US but that the Supreme Court could not grant his writ because the law directing them to do so was unconstitutional. This is brilliant for two reasons. First by the time the case came before the court Courts too, because of the principle of starry decisis, which is Latin for let the decision stand. This doesn't mean that future Supreme Courts can never overturn the decisions of prior courts, it's just that they try very hard to not do it. This idea of precedent is one way that judges can be said to make laws. Appellate decisions are like common law, and that they're binding on future courts, and constrain their decisions, and because they don't have to be grounded in a specific statute. Other courts have to follow the higher courts' interpretation of every state, and now the police are supposed to read the Miranda rights to anyone they arrest. So those are the very basics of judicial review. We've probably raised as many questions as we've answered, but that's why we're making a bunch of these videos so we can teach it all. All of it.\", 'Politics'], [\" We humans, a planet earth, benefit from a great coincidence. It's a coincidence of time and of space and of math. The coincidence is this. The sun is about 400 times wider than the moon, and it's also, on average, about 400 times farther away than the moon. The apparent size of an object in the sky depends on how big it is and how far Moon, the moon can be as much as 5 degrees away from the sun, passing above or below the sun in the sky, thereby missing it from our perspective. But sometimes the moon is in the right place at the right time, and at New Moon it lies perfectly in line between the sun and the Earth. And when that happens, we get a solar eclipse. This, we get a total solar eclipse. But what does that look like from the ground? You don't get a total solar eclipse right away. First, the edge of the moon slips in front of the sun, and we see a little dip in the sun's limb, its edge, as seen from the earth. That's the start of the penumbra sweeping over you. As the moon slowly moves, that dip grows, becoming a bite. The sun becomes a thick crescent, then a thin one. As the sun becomes an ever thinner crescent, the sky begins to darken. Then, right at the moon's edge allow sunlight to stream past. We see these as bright patches around the eclipse sun, which are called Bailey's beads, because they were first described by English astronomer Francis Bailey in 1836. Because the moon and sun are very nearly the same apparent size, totality is brief. The longest it can last is only about seven or eight minutes. That's how long it takes the umbra to move over one spot on the Earth. When totality ends and the moon starts to entire face of the sun, and it leaves a ring of light around the black circle of the moon. The technical name for this shape is Annulus, so this event is called an annular eclipse. A lot of people think if you look at a total solar eclipse, you can go permanently and completely blind. That's really not true, but some parts of eclipse watching are more dangerous than others. I mean, obviously, it's not a good idea to stand there and stare at the sun. Looking at even the un-edoo for more information on eye safety. Now, you don't have to worry about herring your eyes at all when viewing a lunar eclipse, because in that case, it's the Earth that blocks the sun and the Earth's shadow falls on the moon. So go nuts! But one big difference between the two kinds of eclipses is who can see them. A solar eclipse is localized to one spot on the Earth, or really, a swath along the ground as the moon's umbral shadow sweeps across the Earth's surface. But a lunar eclipse is when the moon moves to enter the Earth's umbra, and the real eclipse begins. At first it looks like a bite is taken out of it. That curving arc is the shadow of the edge of the Earth. The moon moves deeper and deeper into the shadow until it's completely darkened. The Earth is bigger than the moon, so the Earth's umbra is much wider. While a solar eclipse is over in minutes, a total lunar eclipse can last nearly two hours. I once saw a lunar eclipse so deep that it took me a minute to find the moon in the sky. There's not a lot of new science you can do with a lunar eclipse. But if you know a little geometry, He won't get any more total eclipses.\", 'Astrology'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace. Uranus. Uranus. Uranus. Uranus. Ur-Urenos. There are five planets in our solar system. You can see without a telescope. Well, eye if you have very sharp eyesight and very dark skies. It's right on the thin, hairy edge of visibility. What's funny is that several people had observed it before Herschel, but none had noticed its movement. Some even catalogued it on their maps as a star. The planet is massive, about 14.5 times the mass of Earth, but not terribly dense. Thiss. Not that we'll ever see that. When we observe the planet, we're only seeing the top of its atmosphere. Besides hydrogen and helium, the air there is about 2% methane. Methane is really good at absorbing red light, which means the light we see reflected from Uranus is mostly green and blue, making the planet look distinctly cyan or west to east. The sun spins that way and all the planets do as well, except Venus and Uranus. While Venus has flipped all the way over, Uranus is tilted by about 98 degrees. That means that in the summer, its axis is pointed almost directly at the sun, so seasons on Uranus are pretty extreme. Biodersolar system standards. Weird. No one knows why Uranus is tipped so much. An obvious thought somewhat and it settled back together into this weird mishmash. But the reason I like it so much has a lot of similarities. Like its green brother, it probably has a rocky core surrounded by a thick icy mantle of water, ammonia and methane. Above that is an atmosphere of hydrogen, helium and methane. But there are differences too. Neptune is more massive than Uranus. 17 times Earth's mass versus just 14.5 for Uranus. Neptune is slightly smaller than Uranus, which means it's a lot denser. Also, while Uranus is teal, Neptune isortices, cyclones, which allow us to see through the upper atmosphere and peer farther into Neptune's depths. Neptune has a magnetic field, and, like Uranus, it's offset from the planet's center. Perhaps that icy mantle is at work, somehow interfering with the generation of the magnetic fields in both planets. Neptune lava there. Also, tritin has been seen to have active geysers of nitrogen erupting from its surface. They're probably due to warming from the sun, and they make grand search that resulted in the discovery of Pluto. But Pluto was far too small to affect Neptune. When Voyager passed both Uranus and Neptune, it found the masses of the planets were different than what had been measured from Earth. When the new masses were used in the orbital equations, Uranus and Neptune\", 'Astrology'], [\" The sky we now know is full of stars and planets. Stars are massive enough to fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores, generating energy. The heat created by that process tries to expand them, but their gravity balances that outward force, creating an equilibrium. Planets, even gas giants like Jupiter, are far too small to generate fusion. The was becoming clear. If it had less than about 0.075 times the sun's mass, roughly 75 times the mass of Jupiter, it simply lacked the oomph needed to squeeze hydrogen together hard enough to generate fusion. What would such an object look like? Well, it might form like a star, collapsing from a gas cloud just like the sun did 4.6 billion years ago. But insteadfs were like, and a lot of progress was made despite there not being any actual examples of them found. But the hunt was on. Now as I talked about in episode 26, astronomers classify stars by their temperature. The hottest are O stars, then B stars, which are slightly cooler, down through AFGK, and with the coolest stars being M. But then in 1988, astronomers found a star that was so cool, it was distinct from brown dwarfs from regular stars. The lithium test isn't perfect, but it does work under a lot of circumstances. Astronomers began using it to look for actual, real brown dwarfs. And so they found one. In 1995, a group of astronomers was observing the Pleiades, a nearby cluster of stars that's visible to the naked eye. They were trying to find after it was installed on Hubble in 1997. I was lucky enough to work on the spectrum we took of it, and it was freaky. It emitted almost no light in the visible part of the spectrum, and rocketed up in the infrared. I'd seen a lot of stellar spectra before, but nothing like this. Remember, they have molecules in their atmospheres that absorb specific colors of light. In some brown dwarfs, there are molecules like methane and even water, well, steam at those temperatures that are pretty picky about what colors they absorb. Some of these molecules block more red light than blue, so that messes with their colors, making them look magenta. Wise takes pictures in the around the mass of Jupiter, which means that a brown dwarf, twice as massive as our biggest planet, won't actually be a whole lot bigger. So what's the difference between a small brown dwarf and a really big planet? Well, not much which orbits the binary star Alpha Centauri. It's about 4.2 light-years away. In 2013, astronomers announced the discovery of a binary pair of brown dwarfs called Lumon 16. They're only 6.5 light-years away and became the third closest known star system to Earth.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Welcome to our solar system. Below you will find our Sun. Our star is two octillion tons of hot hydrogen gas emitting 400 Septillion joules of energy spins backwards. The third, and best understood, planet is Earth. Our home planet has a dense metal core, a thick viscous rock mantle, and a thin crust. It's unique in the solar system for having humans and permanent liquid water on its surface. Other planets may get the former soon. At 3,470 kilometers in diameter, our moon has the largest moon to planet The It was originally discovered in 1930 and categorized as a planet, but it was recategorized as a minor planet in 2006.\", 'Astrology'], [\" As we take our grand tour of the solar system here on Crash Course Astronomy, we're going to skip over the asteroids for now. We'll get to them, I promise. And instead, pay a visit to the king of the planets, the big guy, the top dog, the big cheese, the head honcho, the worlds and their own right, and so we'll dive into them, literally, in the next episode. When we look at Jupiter, we're not seeing its surface, we're seeing the tops of its clouds, and they're a strange mix of permanence and change. The atmosphere of Jupiter is banded with multiple stripes running parallel to its equator. The lighter color stripes are called zones, and the darker ones, belts. They're fairly stable, though their shape and coloring change over time. Belts and zones circulate around the planet in opposite directions speeds of 500 km per hour. And it's old. It was first seen in the late 17th century. Imagine a storm on Earth lasting for more than three centuries. And it may be far older. The 1600s is just when we first spotted it. So why is it so stable? It turns out that a vortex, a local spinning region and a fluid, can persist if the fluid metallic, hydrogen. We think of hydrogen as being a gas, or if it gets really cold or liquid. But under the ridiculous pressures generated deep inside Jupiter, hydrogen undergoes this strange transformation. Individual atoms don't hold onto their electrons, but instead, share them. This means the hydrogen can conduct electricity and has was thick, rich with material. It's possible that several large protoplanets were forming, collided, and stuck together to really kickstart Jupiter's growth. If that were the case, it started out with a rocky metallic core, and once it got big enough, it drew in that gas that made it the giant we see today. Another idea is that 1 1,000th the mass of the sun. Far too little to undergo fusion in its core. If you want to turn Jupiter into a star, you'd have a lot of work ahead of you. You'd have to take Jupiter and then add about 80 more Jupiter's to it. On Earth, our weather is powered by heat from the Sun, but on Jupiter, they get their energy from the planet itself. Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, no doubt due to all of that metallic hydrogen inside it, coupled with its rapid rotation. Like Earth, it has a rorae at its poles, as the solar wind has funneled down to the cloud tops. As we'll see next week, Jupiter's moons affect the magnetic field and a rorae on Jupiter as well. Jupiter also has a ring, though it's not nearly as grand. There's an idea that Jupiter's gravity tends to take comets that fall toward the inner solar system and fling them away into interstellar space. Over the eons, this has cleaned out a lot of otherwise dangerous objects that could have eventually hit Earth. On the other hand, Jupiter has a tendency to warp the orbits of some other comets so that they do swing by the Earth. It's hard to say if Jupiter's influence is a net benefit or not. But either way, it's clearly the two Septillion-ton gorilla in the solar space.\", 'Astrology'], [\" The Earth is a planet. That's a profound statement and one that's not really all that obvious. For thousands of years, planets were just bright lights in the sky, one dimensional points that wandered among the fixed stars. How could the Earth be one of them? With the invention of the telescope, those dots became worlds, and with spacecraft, they became places. The Earth went from being our unique home in the universe to what's going on deep inside our planet. So let's take a look. Like the sun, the Earth is a many-layered thing. At its very center is the core, which actually has two layers, the inner core and the outer core. The inner core is solid and made mostly of iron and nickel. These are heavy elements and sank to the center of the planet when it was forming, leaving lighter elements like oxygen, silicon, and nitrogen to rise to the surface. The solid inner core is about 1,200 kilometers in radius sec. On top of the mantle is the crust, a solid layer of rock. The overall density of the rock in the crust is less than in the mantle, so in a sense it floats on the mantle. There are two types of crust on Earth, oceanic crust, which is about 5 km thick, and continental crust, which is a much beefier 30 to 50 km thick. Still, the crust is very thin compared to the other layers. The crust isn't a solid piece though. It's broken up into right through the middle of a continental plate. As the plate moves, the hotspot forms a linear chain of volcanoes over millions of years. Volcanoes create new land as material wells out, but they also pump gas out of the earth too. A large part of Earth's atmosphere was supplied from volcanoes. The interior of to a bar magnet, with a magnetic north pole and south pole, which lie close to the physical spin axis poles of the Earth. The loops of magnetisms surround the Earth and play a very important role. They deflect most of the charged particles from the solar wind, and they trap some too. Without the geomagnetic field, that solar wind would hit the Earth the air, creating currents of rising air, which carry water with them, forming clouds, which in turn is why we have weather. At a height of about 25 kilometers on average is a layer of ozone, a molecule of oxygen that's good at absorbing solar ultraviolet light. That kind of light can break apart biological molecules, so the ozone layer is critical for our protection. Incidentally, the Earth's magnetic field does more than trap solar wind particles. It likely, some of this water formed when the Earth itself formed, and some may have come from comet and asteroid impacts billions of years ago. The exact proportion of locally-sourced versus extraterrestrial water is still a topic of argument among scientists. Earlier, I mentioned trace molecules of gas in the atmosphere. One of these is carbon dioxide, which only constitutes about 0.04% of the lower atmosphere. But it's critical. Sunlight to Earth right now. The Earth is the only habitable planet in the solar system. And you know what? We should keep it that way. Today you learn that the Earth is a planet with a hot core, a thick layer of molten rock called the mantle, and a thin crust. The outer core generates a strong magnetic field which protects the Earth's atmosphere from the onslaught of the solar wind. Motion in the mantle creates volcanoes, and the surface is mostly covered in water. The Earth's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, and it's getting warmer due to human influence.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Compared to human experience, the universe has been around a long time, nearly 14 billion years. That's a soul-crushingly long time. That's older than Earth, older than the Sun, older than, well, everything, pretty much by definition. And yet, when you think about time itself, how long is 14 billion years, really? It seems like a long time to us now, but time keeps on slipping into the future, and every day the universe is a wee bit distressing to some people, but I want to say that it's not all darkness and dissolution. Well, to be honest, it's mostly darkness and dissolution, but there is some light, almost literally, at the end of the long, long tunnel. I'm going to have to use some pretty big numbers in this episode, and by big, I mean... Big. Probably bigger than any numbers you've come across before. I'll have to use scientific Universe, which is a pretty good read. Their divisions aren't official in any way, but I think they did a good job given what we know. So let's use them. First came the primordial era, which we already went over in the last episode. It's basically everything from the moment the universe big-banged up to when the first stars formed about 400 million years later. The second era is the one we live in now, where stars rule the night. This is the St lasts another 50 billion years, or 100, it hardly matters. When the longest star sticks around for a trillion years, why quibble about a few billion here and there? As this happens, galaxies will change color and fade. Most spiral galaxies have disks that are a vibrant blue hot and fade over time. How long that takes depends on how massive they are in other factors, but it's safe to assume that they'll have cooled to room temperature at best in a few trillion years. And the deeper we get into the degenerate era, the cooler they'll be. They'll our own bloated, dark galaxy. The rest of the universe will be forever cut off from us. Not that there'll be all that much to see anyway. And I hate to say this, but even that won't last. Our models of how subatomic particles behave predicts that over very long periods of time, protons, the positively charged particles in's where it is forever. No, but that's a pesky word forever. When you're talking 10 to the 50th, 10 to the 60th, 10 to the 90th years, what does forever mean? Back in the 1970s, physicists Stephen Hawking worked out the talking here. But it'll happen, eventually. As black holes lose mass, they emit particles and energy faster. So each time one evaporates completely, it'll emit a flare of light, like a small bomb going off. During the black hole era or electromagnetism, or anything, can cross it. It will be as if that part of the universe across the horizon is ripped away from us, stretched beyond breaking. Over time, according to this hypothesis, the cosmic horizon will eventually shrink until hours is wound down. of the universe. What's left behind in its wake is something new, something different. We literally can't know. This idea actually gives me hope. Think of it as a cosmic reboot. The universe has led a long, long life and lingered an unimaginably slow death. This gives it a new lease, a chance to start over again. Maybe this is similar to how our universe came into being in the first place, as a quantum fluctuation in some other universe, butting off from there to create everything we know. Maybe this has happened before and will happen in\", 'Astrology'], [\" Stars in the sky look pretty, flickering intense diamonds dotting the velvety night. But make no mistake, they are churning cauldrons of violence, barely constrained thermonuclear generators, creating enough energy to vaporize the Earth a thousand times over. Their lives depend on it. Heck, our lives depend on it. But in their case, how they live and how long they live depends on how much pressure the star has in its core. A higher mass star squeezes hydrogen harder, so it fuses far more quickly. The rate is so much higher in fact that even though they're a lot bigger than low mass stars, high mass stars run out of hydrogen fuel in their cores more quickly. The lower mass a star is, the longer it lives. In the lowest mass stars, cool red dwarfs be nearly pure helium, plus whatever heavier elements it was born with. Infusion will cease. It'll then cool, which will take many more billions of years. Finally, it'll be a cold black dead star. And for them, that'll be pretty much that. Or so we think, the universe is far too young for any of these red dwarfs to have run out of fuel yet. That's true for stars at the lower end of the trapped there, unable to be used as fuel, and it's building up in the core like ash in a fireplace. As it does, the density in the Sun's core slowly increases. When you compress a gas, it heats up. That means every day the Sun's core gets a wee bit hotter. That extra heat works its way out through our star, heating up the outer layers, too. will be giving off more total energy than it does now, but its surface area will increase so much that the amount of energy radiated per square centimeter will go down. There'll just be a lot more square centimeters. This a weird twist, due to a lot of very complicated physics, the core itself winds up expanding, absorbing most of that energy. In the end, less energy is pumped into the outer layers, so creating huge surges in energy production. It'll lose even more mass each time. Finally, though, we approach the endgame. The Sun doesn't have enough mass to squeeze carbon atoms enough to fuse them. They build up in the core until there's no more helium, and fusion stops. On top sun expands, remember, it loses mass. That means its gravitational pull will weaken and Earth will move out from the sun into a bigger orbit. If things work out right for us, the Earth will back off fate than lower-mass stars like the Sun. And trust me, we'll cover that in lots of fun details soon. And while this all sounds very bleak, not all is lost, this is all part of the natural cycle of the universe. And in fact, we wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for the way stars live and die. Be thankful for what you have, and that we can not only observe it, but understand it too. Today you learned that very low-mass stars live a long,\", 'Astrology'], [\" We live and stop me if I'm going too fast on a planet. I mean sure, duh. But this isn't the natural state of the universe, or at least it's not the way things usually are. Most of the universe is pretty empty. That's why we call it space. And if I were to magically transport you someplace randomly in the cosmos, the chances are you'd be a million light-years from the nearest substantial object. Evolving into a bitter feud over who thought of what first. But whoever it was, who first got it right, now we have a much better understanding of how gravity works. Well, one thing before we get to gravity, an important concept that comes up a lot is mass. It's a bit tricky to define, but you can think of it as how much stuff makes up an object. I know that's not very scientific sounding, but it's not a bad way to think about it. Something with more mass has, and the force drops by 10 times 10 equals 100 times. Gravity is also attractive. It can only draw things in, not repel them. But how it attracts things is where it gets fun. If I hold up a rock and let go of it, it falls to the ground. What might be hard to see is that it gets faster the longer it drops. Forces accelerate objects, so the longer the force acts, the more the object's velocity changes. In this case, getting faster. That's not a terribly interesting orbit. So what if, instead of dropping the rock, we throw it? That gives it a little bit of sideways motion. So instead of hitting the ground at my feet, it hits a bit farther away. If I throw it harder, it moves horizontally even more before it hits. What if I throw it really hard? This is where Newton's genius comes in. He realized that if you throw the ball hard enough sideways, it will fall at the exact same rate the earth, the more elongated the orbit gets. An orbit like this is still closed. That is, the orbit repeats itself, and the rock is still bound to the Earth by gravity. At some point, open. The rock never stops, even at infinity. It just keeps moving up. Like all forces, gravity gets weaker with distance. In space you have the same mass as you do on Earth, but no weight. If another astronaut pushed on you, they'd have to exert a force. But if you stood on a scale in space, it wouldn't register anything. Space is weird.

So now we've come to the last of the naked eye planets in the solar system. Saturn. It's the second largest planet, but ironically, the least dense. In fact, if you could find a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float in. That's really noticeable through a telescope. When we look at Saturn, we only see its cloud tops. These clouds are mostly ammonia ices with water clouds lower down. The atmosphere is banded like Jupiter's, but the pattern is much fainter, probably due to Saturn being farther from the sun and therefore colder, as well as the atmosphere being deeper than resolution to really figure out what they were. He thought Saturn might be three objects in close proximity. Some decades later, the Dutch scientist Christian Huygens correctly interpreted their appearance as a ring surrounding the planet. They're not solid. If they were, they'd get torn apart since that got disrupted by a huge collision. The shattered moon particles would have spread around Saturn, and any of them that were on a tilted orbit would quickly collide with others, and in the end that would average out all their orbits to form a flattened ring. Or maybe there was once a large moon near Saturn that was big enough to be differentiated. That means the rocky bits fell to the moon's core while the ice stayed near the surface. As it plowed through the material around the proto you orbit Saturn twice for every one time, minus goes around. This is called a resonance, and it means that the particles at that location get tugged repeatedly by the gravity of minus, which in essence, yanks them out of their orbit. There are quite a few gaps in the rings caused by moons. In fact, there are hundreds of ringlets in the main rings thicker than our air on Earth. I wouldn't suggest breathing it though. It's mostly nitrogen, with a smattering of methane and hydrogen. It's also 180 below zero Celsius there. Definitely don't stick your tongue on a flagpole on Titan. Titan's atmosphere has a thick layer of haze that of another world. The shorelines of the lakes appear to change over time, too, hinting very strongly that Titan has weather driven by methane as opposed to water here on Earth.

But I put it in the top three places to look, including Europa and Titan. It's weird, isn't it? We've always looked for planets, where cheap department store telescope when I was five or six, setting it up in our driveway and aiming it at Saturn. I still remember seeing Saturn in the eyepiece, a perfect jewel, the ring's small but vivid and sharp. It's hard to believe it's real when you see it. And even after all these years, it's my favorite target when I'm stargazing. I'll never get tired of watching people's faces when they see it for the first time. They gasp. Their eyes get wide. Their mouths drop open.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hey folks, I'm Phil Plaid and this is Crash Course Astronomy. You know, I can't think of any object in the sky that's captured our imagination, like Mars has. The Red Planet was once thought to be the God of War, and in more modern times has been the setting for a zillion science fiction novels, movies, TV shows, and more. And now that we've gone there, landed there, roved there, it's become is rich in iron that's oxidized, forming rust. The dust coats a lot of the surface, giving it a butterscotch or ochre coloring, and also gets blown into the atmosphere. A lot of the surface of Mars is also gray volcanic rock called basalt, and together with other minerals gives Mars its overall reddish look. We can get a decent view of Mars from Earth using telescopes, but small features evidence at once did. Tharsis was probably over a hotspot, a plume of hotter material rising up through the planet's mantle. That's what may have created the bulge, and as the plates slowly moved, the plume punched through the crust to create the chain of three smaller, but still huge, volcanoes. But the grandest Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling Mars so long, it's actually seeing new craters from fresh impacts on the surface. However, the atmosphere is substantial enough to interact with the surface. Winds blow seasonally, filling craters with the ubiquitous dust. There's also sand on Mars, made of belt. To be honest though, it's not clear what their origins are. Phobos orbits Mars only 6000 kilometers over the surface, and it moves so rapidly in its orbit that it orbits faster than Mars rotates. From the surface it appears to rise in the west and set in the east. Tides from Mars are altering its orbit, slowly lowering Phobos closer and closer to the surface. In a few million years, and minerals we know need water to form. There's even evidence Mars had oceans. But that's all gone now. What happened? It's not clear. Billions of years ago, Mars was almost certainly warmer and had a thicker atmosphere. But for some reason, its internal dynamo shut down, and its magnetic field disappeared. This left it vulnerable to the solar wind, and over billions that doesn't mean it's off-limits. Getting to Mars is hard. Over half the missions sent there have failed, but not impossible. We've had amazing successes, including orbiters, landers, and rovers. I'd say we've learned as much about the Red Planet in the past couple of decades as we had in all the centuries of study before them. Still, all we've sent are robots. They're good and relatively inexpensive, but they're slow. They can only cover so life on Mars and it'll be us. Today you'll learn that Mars is smaller and colder than Earth. It has polar ice caps and lots of rusty dust covering its surface. It also has the solar system's largest volcano in valley. It's dry now, but once upon a time was much warmer and wetter with a thicker atmosphere. It may even have had life. Crash Course Astronomy is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.

I may be biased, but I think astronomy is the most beautiful of all sciences. Sure, other fields of science have lots of eye candy, but all I have to do is pull out a shot of Saturn and I win because Saturn. a higher energy level. When the electrons drop back down, they emit light. The gas glows, and we call this an emission nebula. The color of an emission nebula depends on the gas in it and how hot it is. Hydrogen, for example, glows most strongly in the red, and we see that color in most emission nebula. Oxygen tends to glow green, but to a lesser extent, it light of nearby bright massive stars. In this case though, the nebula isn't made of gas, but is instead mostly dust. I don't mean like the hair and skin-flaked dust bunnies you find under your couch either. When astronomers talk about dust, they mean tiny grains, a micron across. Just so you know, a human hair is 100 times wider than that. These tiny grains contain things like silicates, aluminum oxide, and calcium. And in toward us. Thick dust is also very good at absorbing visible light. If a star is embedded in enough dust, the light from it is dimmed considerably. If the cloud is dense enough or big enough, the dust can completely extinguish the light seen from a star. At the same time, if the dust is at the right density, the blue light from a star inside a dust cloud gets scattered, while the red light can get through. This effect red in star light, and in some dust clouds, it to be fuzzy, and through a telescope or with long exposure images, you get unmitigated majesty. The Orion Nebula is a star-forming factory. A bunch of stars have been born in it. Some of them are very massive and incredibly luminous. The entire nebula is lit by four stars located in its heart, collectively called the trapezium. These are four br as a flattened disk of gas and dust. When we look at the Orion Nebula with Hubble, we see those disks. They're called protoplanetary disks, and they're so dense that they absorb almost all the light from the stars forming inside them. So they're dark, and we see them in silhouette against the brighter gas of the nebula. Unless you look in the infrared, that kind of light can pierce the dark disk, and Observing their infrared light, we can also see the stars embedded inside them. There are several of these giant towers in the Eagle Nebula, three of which have been called the Pillars of Creation. Stars are forming at their tips. Eventually though, the light from the mass of stars will wind, zapping away at the structures, dissolving them. There's also some very hot gas in the nebula that might nebula, super posed on a bright emission nebula. By coincidence, the dense dark material is shaped like a gigantic chess piece and it's called the Horsehead Nebula. It's being eroded by a star called Sigma Oriana's off the top of the frame here, and that's also making the gas behind it glow in that sharp ridge. One of my favorite nebulae blocking the light from the reflection nebula behind and looking like dark rivers running through it. But when you use a telescope that can see light with a wavelength of a millimeter or so, that dust glows brightly, threading through M78 like ribbons of fire. Like so much else in life, what you see really depends on how you see it. If there's a life lesson there, feel free to take it.\", 'Astrology'], [\" I love astronomy. You may have noticed. But there's one really frustrating aspect of it. Everything we study is really far away. Nearly everything we understand about the universe comes from light emitted or reflected by objects. It'd be nice if we could get actual samples from them stuff coming from space is called a meteoroid. The phenomenon of the meteoroid getting hot and blazing across the sky is called a meteor. And finally, that hits the ground, we get hot due to friction with air. Actually, a far bigger contributor to their heat is compression. other, the collision can eject little bits of material that then orbit the Sun on their own. If their orbit crosses the Earth, then you have a potential meteor. It may take a few million years, but at some point the Earth and the meteoroid are at the same place at the same time. And boom. But sometimes meteoroids travel in packs. When that happens, we can get meteor showers. Many dozens, or Camelopartilids, or the Camelopar Dalids. And since the Earth hits a specific comet stream around the same time every year, the showers are annual. The Perseids are in August and the Leonids in November. Watching a meteor shower is easy. Just go outside and look up. Generally, they're better after local midnight. The Earth plows into the meteoroids, so facing the direction of Earth's orbital motion means more meteors. Just like you get more raindrops on the front windshield of your car than on the back to the ground and become a meteorite. Sometimes the immense pressure of ramming Earth's air causes the incoming meteoroid to crumble or even explode, raining down dozens or hundreds of smaller pieces. Typically, they slow rapidly after their blaze of glory and simply fall the rest of the way to the ground. The air up there is cold and their interiors are cold from being in space so long. So, despite what you might think, meteorites don't come from the center of a large asteroid, one big enough that metals fell to the center via gravity. Again, a big impact blew the asteroid up, scattering its material around the asteroid belt, and with some on orbits that eventually intersected Earth. Stony irons are the rarest. Some have green or orange crystals of a mineral called olivine embedded in a web of metal. Called palocytes, they may be the most beautiful of all meteorites. I was no warning for this event. The asteroid was essentially too small to detect while it was out in space. Well, for now at least. Telescopes are coming online soon that should be able to find smaller asteroids and give us some warning. Astronomers are more worried about one's roughly 100 meters across or bigger. These can do serious damage on a city-wide scale or larger, but at the moment, aren't easy to spot much of the dinosaurs. Crash Course Astronomy? Hey Crash Course Meteorism! Cool!

If you watch for a few hours, you can see them rise and set as the Earth rotates once a day. And if you go outside the next night at the same time, you'll see that things look pretty much the same as they did the night before. The stars rise and set, Polaris hangs to the north, and so on. One day hardly makes any difference to the sky's appearance. as it does, from Earth's perspective, distant stars appear to move their positions relative to the sun. So one day we might see a star very near the sun, but the next day the angle is a bit bigger. At some point, about six months after we first saw it, the star is directly opposite the sun in the sky. Then the angle starts to shrink again as the star approaches the sun from the, Virgo, Leo, Cancer, and the rest. Eventually, over a year, the sun returns to Sagittarius and the cycle starts again. But even though we talk about this process in terms of the sun's movement, it's really the path traveled by the Earth that creates this effect, as our perspective moves with it. And of course, the planets move in the sky as well. Mercury, Venus, Mars, they orbit the sun too, and they planet. Imagine for a moment that the Earth's axis were exactly perpendicular to its orbit, straight up and down. If that were the case, every day, the sun would take the same path across the sky. If you were on the equator, the sun would rise, go exactly overhead, and then set. If you're on the pole, the sun would appear to go around the horizon every day, neither rising nor setting. It would always be twilight. But that's not the case. The Earth is tilted. that the Earth has seasons because it orbits the Sun on an ellipse, and so it's closer to the Sun in summer and farther in winter. While it's true the orbit is elliptical, Earth is closer to the Sun in January, on the order of 5 million kilometers or so than it is in July. It's the angle of the Sun's rays that makes winter cold and summer hot, not our distance from the Sun. Also, you may know that when it's summer in the northern star, Vega. Also, the date the Sun is in a particular zodiac constellation, changes slowly due to procession as well. When the ancients first thought up this idea, the Sun was in aries on March 22nd, the Vernal Equinox, what some people call the first day of spring. But due to procession, it's now in Pisces. That's why your astrological sign doesn't match where the Sun actually is in the sky. 2000 years of procession has know the streets in your neighborhood. They could see the stars rise and set. They knew the glory of the Milky Way sprawled across the heavens, even if they didn't know exactly what it was. We do know now, with our knowledge gained over the centuries, but it comes at the cost of losing touch with the sky, not living under it as much as we once did. I've spent thousands of hours over my life at night just simply looking up, watching the stars, appreciating the universe as I can see it. The things I have witnessed\", 'Astrology'], [\" In the last episode, I talked about stars that are orbiting one another. When it's two stars, it's called a binary. Three stars would be a trinary system and so on. But what happens if you have solar system, where the Sun dominates and provides a singular central source of gravity holding the planets under its sway, in a cluster all the stars contribute to the overall gravity. So there's more general gravitational schmear. The stars all orbit the cluster's center of mass, even though there may not be anything at the very center. Not only that, but the stars don't all orbit in a flat plane like our planets do. Instead, their orbits are tilted in all different dehelium like the Sun is. The most massive stars can be identified by their spectra, which gives us their mass, and then that can be used to get the cluster's age. You might expect the distribution of cluster ages to be all over the place, with some young, some old, and some middle-aged. But in fact, most clusters are young, and very few are older than roughly 50 million years. That's because they evaporate. All the stars in the cluster interact with each other via gravity. process is aided by collisions with gas clouds and the tidal forces of the collected stars in the galaxy itself. Given enough time, the cluster just disappears. The individual stars are left to orbit the galaxy on their own. About a thousand open clusters are known, but their days are numbered. Eventually, over millions of years, they'll go away V-shape of the horns of Taurus, the bull. As someone who enjoys taking out a telescope and observing the sky, I'm a fan of open clusters. A few are favorite targets whenever I'm outside. I love looking at the Pleades with binoculars. An M35 at the foot of Gemini is another must-see for me in the winter through my telescope. But as much fun as they are to find, and as beautiful as they are to long, long time. The stars in globular clusters tend to have less heavy elements in them too, which you expect if they're old. Massive stars explode and scatter their heavy elements into the universe, and that takes time. It took billions of years for stars like the sun to form, the ones with more heavy elements in them. Old stars formed before the universe was seeded with those elements, so they have more lighter elements in them than later generation stars like the sun. Despite being larger than open clusters, globulars, called blue stragglers. And they were a mystery at first, since they shouldn't be there in such old objects. But astronomers figured out they're actually stars that have physically collided and merge to form a single, higher-mass star. Such collisions are extremely rare in space, but the stars are so tightly packed in globulars that collisions are more common. We know of about 150 globular clusters orbiting the Milky Way galaxy, our own local collection you learn that open clusters contain hundreds or thousands of stars held together by gravity. They're young and evaporate over time. Their stars let loose to run space freely. Globular clusters are larger, have hundreds of thousands of stars and are more spherical. They're very old, a significant fraction of the age of the universe itself. And that means their stars have less heavy elements in them, are redder, and probably don't have plenty of\", 'Astrology'], [\" Well, look where we are now. With our backs to the sun and the planets, asteroids and comets behind us flung out into deep space. Trillions upon trillions of such ice balls got tossed around by the planets and moons a few hundred million years after the planets themselves formed. It's not known for sure, but all the pieces fit together really well. In the end, today, there are three rather distinct populations of these objects. can be extremely long. They start their fall from so far away, they swing around the sun at nearly escape velocity, and their orbits are close to being whenever Pluto is closest to the sun, Neptune is always 90 degrees away in its orbit. That's many billions of kilometers distant, way too far to affect Pluto. This is mostly coincidence. We've seen how orbital resonances can be forced by tides and by gravity. But in this case, it's due to attrition. Once upon a time, billions of years ago, there were probably a lot of objects out by Pluto, with orbits of all A moon was discovered in 1978 named Charon. It's actually about one-eighth the mass of Pluto itself. While Charon orbits Pluto, the moon has enough mass that it can be said that Pluto noticeably orbits Charon too. In reality, both circle around their mutual center of mass located between the two. Four more moons were discovered in Hubble images of Pluto in 2005 and so are far fainter. If Pluto is king of the kyper belt objects, it has a lot of loyal subjects. We think the kyper belt may have a hundred thousand objects in it larger than a hundred kilometers wide. If that sounds like a lot, get this. The oort cloud surrounding the solar system may have trillions of icy bodies in it. Trillions! While we know lots of kyper belt do, and sometimes the sun passes near other stars. When we see a long period comet gracing our skies, could we be seeing an object from an alien solar system? Maybe. There is another explanation, but it's highly speculative. Perhaps there's another planet in the solar system, well beyond Neptune. It's possible some very preliminary studies have shown that some long period comets if they get poked into the inner solar system. The Kuiper Belt is a donut shape aligned with the plane of the solar system. The scattered disk is more eccentric and is the source of short period comets. And the Oort Cloud, which surrounds the solar system out to great distances, is the source of long period comets. These bodies all probably formed closer into the sun and got flung out to the solar system suburbs by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Crash Course Astronomy is produced and associated\", 'Astrology'], [\" A lot of people have noted that astronomy is a humbling enterprise to pursue. After all, every time we make a new discovery, we find ourselves further removed from importance. The Earth is but one planet among many, orbiting a sun that is one star among hundreds of billions, out in the suburbs of a galaxy that has won among hundreds of billions more. It's entire galaxy. Galaxies are so big that you can't physically see the nebulae move, but you can measure their Doppler shift, which gives you their velocity. What Ruben expected to see was that the farther out from the center of the galaxy the gas cloud was, the slower it would be moving, just like more distant planets from the sun move more slowly in their orbits. What she got, though, astronomer Fritz Zwicky had drawn a similar conclusion measuring the speeds of galaxies in galaxy clusters. The member galaxies were moving too quickly to stay in the cluster. At the measured speeds, they should have been flung off. Therefore, he concluded, there must be far more gravity in the clusters than just from the visible material. Then they thought of ways they could detect these objects. Cold gas would emit radio waves, for example. But everything they tried came up empty. One by one, they crossed objects off the list. And eventually, everything made of normal matter, atoms and molecules, protons all of matter and energy embedded in it. Although you have to be careful not to take the analogy too literally, in many ways it acts like a fabric with everything stuck to it. This is more than just a theoretical construct. It has real implications. For one, what we perceive as gravity, the force pulling two objects together, was actually just a bending of this fabric of space, a warp. It's like a bowling ball sitting on a soft mattress. The surface of the mattress bends, and if So we can, in theory, measure the mass of the cluster by the distortion of objects behind it. Not only that, but it gives us a map of where that mass is. Astronomers use this method on a cluster of galaxies located about 3.5 billion light-years away, called the bullet cluster. It's a very special object. It's actually not just a cluster, but a collision of two clusters. That's right, two huge groups of galaxies are physically colliding and may eventually merge. Even though the bullet cluster is very far away, there are actually hundreds of galaxies even farther away that can be seen in the optical images. The gravity of the matter in the bullet cluster distorted those background galaxy images subtly, and by very carefully measuring that distortion, a map of all the mass in the bullet cluster was made, including dark matter. If dark matter is made of axion, then you's why it took so long to even know it existed in the first place. But even though it's incredibly elusive, it turns out that dark matter has had a profound effect on the universe. As we'll see in upcoming episodes, we're getting a pretty good idea of how the universe got its start and how it's evolved over the eons. We think smaller objects formed first, clumping together into larger and larger structures. So stars formed first, but there is dark matter. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Today you learn that the kind of matter we see, what we call normal matter, is only one kind of matter. There's also dark matter, which we cannot directly see, and which interacts with normal matter only through gravity. It affects how galaxies rotate, how galaxies move in clusters, and how large structures form in the universe. It can be detected in many ways, one of which is by seeing how its mass affects\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hey, Phil Plaid here, and this is Crash Course Astronomy. In last week's episode, I mentioned that nearly all the information we have about the universe comes in the form of light. But how does that light get made? What can it tell us about these astronomical objects? And honestly, what is light is tied to its wavelength. Light with a shorter wavelength has more energy and light with a longer wavelength has less energy and our eyes have a really convenient way of detecting these different energies. Color. What you think of as the color violet is actually light hitting your eye that has a short wavelength. Red light has a longer wavelength about twice the distance between shorter. So ultraviolet light has a higher energy than violet, x-rays have a higher energy than that, and gamma rays have the highest energy of all. Infrared light has lower energy than red light, microwaves lower than that, and radio waves have the lowest energy. When you look at the whole EM spectrum, you'll probably notice that we really do only see a teeny little sliver of and light with a longer wavelength is redder. Don't take this literally. We don't really mean more blue or more red, just that the wavelengths are decreasing or increasing. So in this lingo, ultraviolet light is bluer than blue, and x-rays are bluer than ultraviolet. So objects that are more energetic, that have a higher temperature, are bluer than cooler redder objects. This rule of thumb works really well for dense objects like iron bars and stars of the electron as orbiting the nucleus, like a planet orbits the Sun. But that's not really the case. The real situation is fiendishly complex and involves pretty hairy quantum mechanics. But in the end, the electron is only allowed to occupy very specific volumes of space around the nucleus, and those depend on the electron's energy. Think of these like stairs on a staircase, where the landing is the nucleus. When you walk up the stairs, you have the right energy to do it. But as I said earlier, energy and wavelength are the same thing, and that's equivalent to color. So when an electron jumps up or down, it absorbs or emits a very specific color of light. Not only that, but the steps are different for different atoms. To stick with our analogy, it's like different atoms are different staircases with different heights between the steps. So when an electron jumps down a step in a hydrogen atom, it emits a different dense stars, the color of the thinner gas depends more on what's in it than its temperature. And this is how we learned what the universe is made of. Stars and gas clouds in space are mostly hydrogen, with some helium-inheavier elements thrown in. Jupiter has methane in its atmosphere, Venus carbon dioxide. Everything in the universe has its own mix of ingredients, like cakes at a bakery. With spectroscopy, we can taste them. But is spinning, and how fast, whether it has a magnetic field, and how strong it is, and even how massive and dense an object is. A vast amount of the fundamental properties of astronomical objects can be found just by dissecting their light into individual colors. Almost everything we know about the universe comes from the light objects in it give off. Pictures of astronomical objects show us their structure, their beauty, and hint at their history. But with spectra, we can examine their\", 'Astrology'], [\" I've talked a lot about observing the night sky with your eyes, just simply going out and seeing what you can see. It's pretty amazing what you can learn just by doing that, and of course that's all we humans could do for thousands of years. But now we can do better. We can use telescopes. The first person to invent the telescope is lost to history. Despite common Look at your eyes. Well, that's tough, so let's think about our eyes for a moment. They also work as light buckets, but they only collect light through our pupils, which even under the best of circumstances are less than a centimeter across, a very tiny bucket indeed. But we can do better. To extend the analogy, a telescope is like a bucket with a funnel at the bottom. All that light that it collects is then concentrated my direction, into my eye. But most of that light misses my eye, falling to the ground all around me. The telescope collects that light, bounces it around, and then channels it into my eye. When the very first telescopes were built, this changing of the direction of light was done using lenses. When light goes from one medium to another, say from going through air to going through water or glass, it changes direction slightly. You see this all the time, a spoon sitting in a glass of water looks bent or broken. The spoon is doing just fine, but in the end what you get is an image that looks bigger. That has obvious advantages. A planet like Jupiter is too far away to see as anything other than a dot to the eye. But a telescope makes it appear bigger, and details can then be seen. When Galileo and other early astronomers pointed their telescopes at the sky, multitudes were revealed. Craters on the moon, the phases of Venus, Jupiter's moons, the rings of Saturn, and so much more. Big lenses are hard to make. They get thin near the edge and break easily. Also, different colors of light bend by different amounts as they pass through the lens. So you might focus a red star, say, and a blue one will still look fuzzy. No less a mind than Isaac Newton figured a way around this. Use mirrors. Mirrors also change the direction light travels. And if you used a curved mirror, you can also bring Is this for a child or an adult? These questions are critical. Most small scopes are refractors, which are good for looking at detail on the moon and planets. They tend to magnify the image more than reflectors do. But they're tricky to use because they flip the image left and right and up and down. Bigger scopes are good for fader objects but are more expensive and can be difficult to set up and use. I hate hearing about a scope that just collects dust because it was bought and hased. So here's what I recommend. Find an observ since, we've learned of other forms of invisible light. Radio, microwave, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. Astronomical objects can be observed in all these flavors of light if we have telescopes that are designed to detect these flavors of light. Radio waves pass right around normal telescopes, ones that we use to observe visible light. X-rays and gamma rays pass right through them as if they aren't even we have digital detectors, similar to the ones in your phone camera, but far larger and far more sensitive. They can be dozens of times more light sensitive than film, able to detect in minutes objects that would have taken hours or more to see using film. These digital cameras can also be designed to detect ultraviolet light, infrared, still true. We learn more about the universe every day, just as we learn that there's more to learn every day, too. That's one of the best parts of being an astronomer. The universe is like a jigsaw puzzle with an infinite number of pieces. The fun never ends. And remember, even with all the wonders revealed by telescopes, your eyes are still pretty good instruments, too. You don't need big fancy equipment to see the sky. The important thing is that you can't\", 'Astrology'], [\" When an 8-20 solar mass star ends its life, it does so with a bang, a supernova. And when it's all over, there's a couple of octillion tons of superheated plasma expanding away from the explosion site at a fraction of the speed of light, a whole mess of energy released in the form of light and neutrinos, and a bizarre little ball of quantum nastiness in the center composed almost Sun, that's just too much of a load to bear, and the collapse continues. Under these huge pressures, a funny thing happens. Protons, electrons, and other subatomic particles get smashed together, and they merge to form neutrons. And this happens to almost all of them. When the core collapses down to about 20 kilometers in diameter, it's essentially a ball the size of a neutron star, well, you'd be very dead, obviously, like immediately, flattened down to a thickness of just a few atoms. And that's because a typical neutron star has a surface gravity 100 billion times stronger than Earth's. I have a mass of about 77 skyrockets and a neutron star can easily have a magnetic field several trillion times stronger than the suns. That's strong enough to erase your credit card from 100,000 kilometers away. See? Ridiculous. All of these properties are brain melting. But are they real? Could an object like this object was half jokingly given the name LGM1. Little Green Men, 1. Now we know over a thousand pulsars in just our galaxy alone, and we know they're the leftover cores of massive stars that exploded. Some spin with periods many seconds or even minutes long. Some are in binary systems They have a crust, probably a few centimeters thick, made of highly compressed but more or less normal matter, squeezed into a kind of highly stiffened crystal state. The magnetic field of the star penetrates this crystal in crust and stretches out for quite a distance. In some neutron stars, the magnetic field is even stronger than usual, and can be, get this, a quadrillion times stronger than the suns. These in a neutron star, this effect is multiplied, hugely. Remember, the crust is phenomenally dense and the gravity is enormous. If the crust strains and snaps, dropping just a single centimeter, the resulting release of energy is vast beyond imagining. This energy is released as a tremendous explosion in the crust, shaking it. This also shakes the magnetic field, which reacts actually compressed the Earth's magnetic field and partially ionized the Earth's upper atmosphere. Oh, did I mention that this magnetar is 50,000 light-years away? That's halfway across the galaxy. That's incredible. At a distance of 500 quadrillion kilometers, its effects were felt more strongly than a powerful flare from the sun. The good with the strongest magnetic fields are called magnetars and are capable of colossal bursts of energy that can be detected over vast distances.

Bright, silvery with tantalizing features on to what shape the moon appears to us, how much of it we see illuminated from the earth. The key to all this is this line, dividing the lit day side from the unlit night side. We call that line the terminator. If you're facing the moon see the dark half, the unilluminated half of the moon. The other side, the far side of the moon, is lit, but we can't see it. It makes sense then to call this the beginning of the moon's cycle. Hence the term, new moon. Now think about this for a sec. Because the moon is near the sun in the sky, it travels across the sky with, rising maybe an hour or two after sunrise. But this means it's up all day and then sets after the sun does. This is the best time to see the crescent moon, when the sun is already set and the sky starts to get dark. The moon will be low over the western horizon and it'll set soon after the sun does. Let's wait a couple of days. Okay, now the moon has moved a bit more in its orbit around the earth and is farther from the sun in the sky. We see a little more of the illuminated part and the crescent is wider. Since it's getting thicker, we say this is is gibbous, which means swollen or convex. Since it's getting wider, this is actually the waxing gibbous phase of the moon. It rises in the late afternoon and is up most of the night. Our next big step comes two weeks after new moon. When it's moved halfway through its orbit, it's now opposite the sun in the sky, 180 degrees around. The Earth is between the moon and sun, so we're looking at the fully illuminated half of the moon. This is the third quarter moon because the moon is three quarters of the way through its cycle. It's a lot like first quarter, but the side that was lit is now dark and vice versa. It's 270 degrees around the sky from the sun. It rises at midnight and sets it new. A few days later, and the moon is a crescent again, getting thinner. It's now a waning crescent. It rises just a couple of hours before times brighter than a full Moon. This glow is called Earthshine, a term I quite like. Even more poetically, it's been called the old Moon in the New Moon's arms, referring to the unlit parts surrounded by the crescent New Moon's horns. That's lovely, isn't it? The Moon is one of the most beautiful and most gratifying objects in the sky to observe. It's different every day. Yet it's also the same, because we see more or less the same half of it, the same face all the\", 'Astrology'], [\" Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. As you might expect, that makes it pretty hot, but also, it's pretty cool. There are seven naked eye solar system objects in the sky. Mercury It orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers, roughly a third the distance of the Earth from the Sun. That's why we never see it stray far from the Sun. From our viewpoint, its smaller orbit keeps it huddled closer to our star. That's why we see it move so rapidly, too. It's closer to the Sun, so the gravity it feels from the Sun is stronger as when it's furthest. Mercury is too small and difficult to observe to see surface features on it, which for a long time made it impossible to figure out how long its day is. Astronomers assumed that the tides from the sun had locked Mercury's spin so that its day was equal to its year, just like our moon spins once for every time it goes around the Earth. However, in 1965, days later, it approaches perihelion again. But it spun one and a half times, and this means the exact opposite side of mercury faces the sun at this closest approach. 88 days later, mercury has spun one and a half times again, and the whole thing repeats. It turns out that's a perfectly legitimate stable configuration, just like the one-to-one spin orbit setup. The way the physics works out, tides like simple multiples. Once the day became two- Mercury pulls away from the Sun, its orbital velocity slows down, and the Sun starts to move west once again as the planet's rotation dominates. If you're at just the right spot on the planet's surface, this means you could actually watch the Sun rise, slow, stop, set again, then rise again. And you think time zones on the Earth are named after artists, musicians, writers, painters, and more, so we have craters like Botticelli, Chekhov, Debussy, Degas, Okyo, Sebelius, Vivaldi, and Zola. There's even one named Tolkien, dipping below the surface. We can only infer what Mercury's internal structure is like. But the planet's dense, nearly as dense as Earth. We know the surface is rocky, millions of kilometers long. This tail is comprised of elements like sodium, calcium, and magnesium, material that's known to be abundant on the surface. Speaking of which, here's a fun fact. Pound for pound, impacts on mercury are more violent than they are on Earth. Mercury has weaker gravity, so it doesn't pull in impactors as hard as the solar system, there can be conditions so cold, ice can exist. But one thing we've learned about nature over and over again, it has a lot more imagination than we do. Today you learn that Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. It's airless and dense and is covered with craters. Its rotation is locked to its orbit in a 2 to 3 ratio, and together with its elliptical orbit makes a day on Mercury very long and very weird. And despite being very hot, there's actually water ice in deep craters at its point.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hello and welcome to Crash Course Astronomy. I'm your host Phil Plait and I'll be taking you on a guided tour of the entire universe. You might want to pack a lunch. Over the course of this series, we'll explore planets, stars, black holes, we get closer and closer to understanding reality. And that is the strength of science. And it's all around us. Whether you know it or not, you're soaking in science. You're a primate. You have mass. Mitochondria in your cells are generating energy. Presumably, you're breathing oxygen. But astronomy is different. It's still science, of course. But astronomy puts you in your place. Because of astronomy, I know we're standing on a sphere of mostly molten across the visible universe, which is 90 billion light-years across and expanding every day even faster today than yesterday due to mysterious dark energy. And even all that might be part of an infinitely larger multiverse. This stands forever both in time and space. See? Astronomy puts you in your place. But what exactly is astronomy? This isn't necessarily an obvious thing to ask. When I was a kid, it was about astronomy and relegate my viewing to my personal backyard telescope. But I still consider myself an astronomer, so that should give you an idea that there's a lot of wiggle room in the profession. In fact, when I worked on Hubble Space Telescope, I was actually hired as a programmer. I coded in the language used by the folks helping to build and calibrate a camera that was due to launch into space and on literally over your head, then who am I to say you're not an astronomer? However you define astronomy, humans have been looking up at the sky for as long as we've been human. Certainly ancient people noticed the big, glowy ball in the sky and how it lit everything up while it was up and how it got dark when it was gone. The other astronomy is science, and astrology... isn't. Millennia ago, astrology was as close to science as you got. It had some of the flavors of science. Astrologers observed the skies, made predictions about how it would affect people, and then those people would provide evidence for it by swearing up and down it worked. The thing rises and sets. The stars themselves wheel around the sky at night. Clearly, the Earth is motionless and the sky is what is actually moving. In fact, if you think about it, geocentrism makes perfect sense that all the objects in the sky revolve about the Earth and are fixed to a series of nested spheres, some of which are transparent, maybe made of crystal, which spin once per day. way objects moved in space. Over time, our math got better. Our physics got better, and our understanding grew. Applied math was a revolution in astronomy, and then the use of telescopes was another. Galileo didn't invent the telescope, by the way, but made them better. Newton invented a new kind that was even better than that, and we've run with the idea from there for life on alien planets seriously and spend billions of dollars doing it. Our galaxy is one of a hundred billion others. We can only directly see four percent of the universe. Stars explode. And when they do, they create the stuff of life. The iron in our blood, the calcium in our bones, the phosphorus that is the backbone of our DNA. The most common kind of star in the universe is so faint, you can't even see it without a telescope.\", 'Astrology'], [\" When you look up at the night sky, and if you happen to live far from city lights, you can see thousands of stars. It seems like the sky is crammed shoulder to shoulder with them. And you're only seeing the tiniest fraction of stars there are. Billions more exist that are too faint to see with just your eyes. As you ponder this incredible number, a natural thought arises. Are there planets circling those stars if you can't spot a planet like that directly, maybe you can spot it indirectly. Imagine two kids, one big and one small, facing each other. They clasp hands and start to spin around. As they do, the little kid, who weighs less, will make a big circle and the bigger kid will make a small circle. The same would be true of a star and planet. As the planet orbits the star, you have to admit, is pretty cool. While this was an incredible discovery, it was still a little unsatisfying. For one thing, pulsars are really weird, and for another, it looked like those planets may have formed around the pulsar after the supernova explosion, from the material left over from the catastrophe. That's nothing at all like our own solar system, and that still left the question open. Are there exoplanets orbiting sun-like stars? We didn't have to just 8 million kilometers out. Compare that to Mercury, which on average is 55 million kilometers from the Sun. Not only that, but the amount of Doppler shift in the star is related to the mass of the planet. A more massive planet pulls harder on the star, making it move more quickly. They found the planet was at least half the mass of Jupiter, and probably moreiferously, as well they should. Science is all about not fooling ourselves. A good scientist wants other scientists to try to poke holes in their ideas. It's disappointing to be wrong, but if we are, we want to know. That all changed in 1999 physically. In 2009, NASA launched a space-based telescope named Kepler, designed specifically to stare at 150,000 stars to detect that telltale dip in light indicating exoplanet transits. And oh my did it work. By early 2015, Kepler found its 1,000th confirmed exoplanet, and there are 500 more confirmed from ground-based telescopes. That is incredible. Taking photos of these planets is still a daunting task, which is why so few have been seen. But we're getting better at this, and as new technology comes along, we'll get more pictures of exoplanets and learn even more about them. The sheer variety of exoplanets is staggering. Hot Jupiters are the easiest to find because they're massive. In our galaxy alone, there may be hundreds of billions of planets. In fact, planets may outnumber stars in the sky. Now, if we've seen planets as big as Jupiter and as small as Mercury, then we must have seen planets around the same size as Earth, right? Yes, yes we have. We've actually found hundreds of them so astronomy. The sky is filled with planets. Today you learned that planets orbiting other stars exist and can be detected with a variety of methods. Nearly 2,000 have been found so far. The most successful method is using transits, where a planet physically passes in front of its parent star, producing a measurable dip in the star's light. Another way is to measure the Doppler shift in a star's light due to reflexive motion as the planet orbits. Exoplanets appear to orbit nearly\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hey, Phil Plaid here, and this is Crash Course Astronomy. Since humans have been human, we've looked to the skies for portents of the future. The sun, the moon, the planets, the stars. They've all been used for prognostication, and so have comets. A fuzzy blob moving slowly across the stars? How could soothsayers resist? But Comets are in many ways similar to asteroids. They're roughly hune chunks of stuff left over from the formation of the solar system. Unlike asteroids, which are mostly rock with a dash of ice and maybe metal, comets are a more balanced mixture of ice and rock. And by ice, I mean frozen water, but also frozen carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide in it, can be freed and leave the nucleus as well. This material is what forms the comet's tail, but how that happens depends on which material you're talking about. The gas and the dust from comets form two different tails. Gas molecules emitted, as low as a few hundred atoms per cubic centimeter. The air you breathe is a million billion times denser. In 1910, Earth passed through the tail of comet Halley. This caused some public fear because cyanogen, a deadly gas, had been detected in the tail. Many of those may actually be pieces from a bigger comet that broke up in space nearly a thousand years ago. But besides those, we know of some comets with orbits that can be short, some with periods of just a few years. Even a century is like a single flap of a mosquito's wing compared to the lifetime of the solar system. How can comets be billions of years old if their orbits bring them close to the sun all the time? Astronomers wondered about this very thing. Over the years, they came pictures of the nucleus. The low-resolution images revealed a dark lump highlighted with two bright spots, later determined to be jets of gas streaming away. These images were used to better determine the position of the nucleus. And a few days later, the European probe Giotto zipped past the nucleus at an incredibly close distance of just 600 kilometers. Those pictures were more detailed and showed us a flying mountain in a regular chunk 15 by 8 kilometers in size. And it was dark, reflecting only. Clearly, the surface is very young. Images show jets of gas emitted from very specific places on the surface. And there are wide circular pits here and there, which may be gas vents, growing wider over time as the ice below is depleted. Surprisingly, the surface is fairly tough and hard when some scientists expected it to be an upcoming episode. But billions of years ago, lots of comets hit the Earth, not long after our planet formed. Together with asteroids, many of which are also rich in water ice, they may have brought a significant amount of water to the origin of life itself. And you thought astronomy was just lying out in a field and looking up. Well, it is, but if you let it, it's also a whole lot more. Today you learn that comets are chunks of ice and rock that orbit the sun. When they get near the sun, the ice turns into a gas, forming the long tail, and also releases dust that forms a different tail.\", 'Astrology'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace. As we saw in the last episode, Jupiter is by far the largest and most massive planet in the solar system. That means it has a very strong gravitational field, which also means magnetic field, likely generated by that liquid core. The surface is similar to our own moon, in that there's very old crater terrain, as well as smoother, younger areas. Ganymede is also crisscrossed with large grooves. It's not clear what the origin of those has an atmosphere, but it's a tad thin, roughly 1-100 billionth, the pressure of Earth's air at the surface. Callisto orbits Jupiter farthest out of the four Biggies, almost 2 million kilometers away. That's too far to gravitationally interact with the other three. When I talk about the moons affecting each other, it's really the other three interacting. Next up is Io. It's only a little bit bigger than our radiation belt around Jupiter, like Earth's Van Allen belts, but far more powerful. The radiation there is so intense it would kill an unprotected human in minutes. Of course, if you're floating in space near Jupiter unprotected, you might have some more immediate concerns. Oh, one more thing. Both Ganymede and Io are magnetically connected to Jupiter. Charge particles flow from those material from the interior of Europa welling up and forming the new surface, kind of like the way lava does on Earth. But in this case, the material is water. It's now thought that Europa has an entire ocean of water sealed up under a solid crust of ice several kilometers thick. Water welling up and moving under the crust causes it to shift, creating all the various surface features. The amount of water that may be locked up on somehow penetrate it, perhaps melting its way down. Chemical sampling could then look for signs of biological activity. That's amazing to me. The idea of life in Europa, even if it's just microbial life, is taken very seriously by astrobiologists, scientists who study the possibility of life in space. It used to be science fiction. Now it's a topic of scholarly in common is that they're tidally locked to Jupiter. They all rotate once for every time they go around the planet. Jupiter's tides are hundreds of times stronger than Earth, so no surprise there. The next biggest moon after the Big Four is way smaller. Named Amalthea, it's a new regular lump about 250 kilometers across its longest dimension. It each fascinating rich and diverse, and there's still a lot more left to explore about them. Today you learn that Jupiter has lots of moons and four big ones. They're mostly rock and ice, though Ganymede, the biggest, may have an iron core. Io is riddled with volcanoes, and Europa has an under-surface ocean that is the object of intense study for scientists looking for life in space.\", 'Astrology'], [\" We have one star in the solar system, the Sun. Sure, it has a lot of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets it, schleps with it as it moves through space. But no other star is part of our family. The Sun is alone Instead of a single clump collapsing and forming a star like our sun, there are two such dense lumps, and they both collect material until they become true stars. There are lots of different masses of the stars, as we saw in episode 26, we can learn everything else about them. How big they are, how brightly they shine, and even how long they live. It's no exaggeration to say that observing binary stars opened up the new scientific field of astrophysics, applying physics to astronomy. And that led to us understanding everything we do about the too. Since Meissar and Alcor orbit each other, it turns out they make up a sextuple star system. Six stars all gravitationally bound to one another. Obviously, stars can be in bigger groups than binaries. There are triple star systems, quadruple, and more. Polaris, the North Star, is actually a pentuple system composed of star, the most bizarre I know of, is called 4U 1820-30, and it's composed of a neutron star and a white dwarf. Their gravity is so strong and they're so close together that they orbit each other in 685 seconds, 11.4 minutes, roughly the length of this episode. Like exoplanets, binary star orbits are tipped every which way to our line of sight from Earth., a lot of interesting information can be gleaned from the system, including the sizes, masses, rotation rates, temperatures of the stars, the size and shape of the orbit, and even the distance to the system. Some stars, like humans, enjoy cuddling. They get so close together they become contact binaries, literally two stars touching each other. massive than the other star. It's a bit like Robinhood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor. If he gets too enthusiastic about it, then the poor become rich while the rich become poor. When we look at that binary system, we see a white dwarf star that is clearly more evolved than a high mass one, the opposite of what we expect. This is called the Algal Paradox after the contact binary star their lives to go Nova, but the name stuck. The explosion can blow out the stream of matter falling from the other star, but when things settle down after a few weeks or months, the matter stream can fall back on the white dwarf and the whole cycle repeats. These are called recurrent nove. If the matter stream is slower, the material can fuse steadily, never piling up, so it never explodes. However, the mass of the white dwarf still increases. If it reaches a mass of around 1.4 times that of the sun, it can be seen literally most of the way across the universe. Ooh, this makes them very, very important indeed, as you'll see in a future episode. Today you learn double stars are stars that appear to be near each other in the sky. But if they're gravitationally bound together, we call them binary stars. Many stars are actually part of binary or multiple systems. If they're close enough together, they can actually touch, merging into one peanut-shaped star. In some close binaries, matter can flow from one star to the other, changing the way it ages.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hey everyone, Phil Plait here with Crash Course Astronomy for one last time. We've come a long way together, you and I, from the banging beginning of the universe to its far, far future, from subatomic scales to super clusters of galaxies. We've watched the sky, mapped how it looks to us from the ground, and then sailed out into the black to investigate its denizens up close. And one of my in 1992, and now we know of thousands, with many thousands more, awaiting confirmation. Most of these exoplanets are giants, far more massive than Earth, and likely to have very thick atmospheres like Neptune or Jupiter. They also orbit so close to their host stars that they're hotter than Venus. But as our techniques got better, we started finding smaller planets farther out. And now we have to wait too much longer though. The James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to Hubble, is a gigantic infrared space telescope currently scheduled to launch in late 2018. It should be able to tease apart the light from some of the nearer and brighter of these distant worlds and look for on its surface. That in turn strongly implies getting life started on planets is easy. The ancient Earth was a tough place to live, yet life took hold within a few hundred million years after it formed. Put this all together and what do you get? If many people walk around with cameras, we see even fewer reports of mysterious lights in the sky than we used to. Or at least most of these lights seen are explainable. Wedding lanterns, balloons, Venus, meteors, the moon, satellites, and so on. All note, astronomers are watching the skies literally all the time. If UFOs were real, we'd be reporting the vast majority. Any aliens that don't have tech can't communicate with us, so they don't play into this. And we know how quickly our technology advances. We're just starting out and already have some pretty cool gizmos. Give us 100 years, 1000. And where will we be? The Earth is over 4.5 billion years old, but we've detected exoplanets far older than that. Life there might be that much more advanced than we are. They might communicate with the next 20 years. If we don't, then given the statistics, it may very well mean that we're alone in the galaxy. Or aliens might exist, but they're not broadcasting. Or, of course, that perhaps there's another flaw in the chain of logic that we've missed. Either way, if they detect a signal or they don't, the resulting conclusion is at least interesting and at most terribly profound. And it's only our first logical step in asked by humans for thousands of years. These are also questions that were once only in the purview of religion and philosophy. But now we have observations to pursue them, evidence to back up our conditional answers. Because of astronomy, because of science, we now stand on the edge of understanding, our cleverness and brilliance having taken us to the point where these questions finally have an answer.

A better way to think of it is all the stuff held sway by the sun's gravity. The sun itself, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust, and very thin gas. If you took a step back, well, a few trillion steps back. And looked at it from the outside, you might define the solar system as the sun. And that's because the sun comprises more than 98% of the mass of the astronomer Ptolemy and the philosopher Aristotle supported that idea, well, people like Aristarchus got left behind. The basic thinking was that the moon, sun and stars were affixed to crystal spheres that spun around the earth at different rates. While it kinda sorta worked to predict the motions of objects in the, so there you go. The planets are smaller, but still pretty huge compared to us tiny humans. At the big end, we have Jupiter, 11 times wider than the a planet. I say, tell me what a planet is first and then we can discuss Pluto. Pluto is what it is. A fascinating and intriguing world. One of thousands, perhaps millions more orbiting the sun out past Neptune. I think that makes it cool enough. All the orbits of the planets lie in a relatively flat disk. That is cloud of these ice balls called the Oort Cloud. They don't follow the plane of the inner solar system, but orbit every which way. So what do all these facts tell us about the solar system? We think they're showing us hints of how the solar system formed. 4.6 billion years or so ago, a cloud floated in space. It was in balance. Its gravity trying to collapse it was counteracted by the meager internal heat that, we baby planets. As they grew, so did the center of the disk. The object forming there was a protostar, or spoiler alert, the protosun. Eventually, its center got so hot that hydrogen fused into helium, which makes a lot of energy. A lot of energy. A star was born. The new sun blasted out, fierce light and heat, that over millions of years, the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that the sun was so bright, that And there you have it, our solar system formed from a disk sculpted by gravity. Echoes of that disk live on today, seen in the flatness of the solar system. This isn't guesswork. The math and physics bear this out. And not only that, we see it happening now, today. When we look at gas clouds in space, we see stars forming. We see protoplanetary disks around them. We see the same thing happening out in the galaxy too. The motions of the objects in this system cost a lot of confusion to ancient astronomers, but we eventually figured out what's what. This episode is brought to you by Squarespace.

I'm just at the summer solstice, the sun shone directly down a well in the city of Sainte at noon. He also knew that at the same time, it was not shining straight down in Alexandria and could measure that angle. There's a legend that he paid someone to pace off the distance between the two cities so we could find the distance between them. But more likely, he just used the numbers found by earlier surveying missions. Either way, but that's not the important part. His methods were sound, and they were used later by great thinkers like Hipparchus and Ptolemy to get more accurate sizes and distances. They actually did pretty well, and all over a thousand years before the invention of the telescope. And I think it also says a lot that these ancient numbers into the orbital equations and get the length of an AU. Grand expeditions were sent across the globe multiple times to measure the transits and didn't do too badly. But our atmosphere blurs the images of the planets, putting pretty big error bars on the timing measurements. The best they could do was motions of the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids. Plus, it meant we could launch our probes into space and explore these strange new worlds for ourselves. See them up close and truly understand the nature of the solar system. And it's even better than that. Knowing the astronomical unit meant unlocking the stars. We have two eyes, and this gives us binocular vision. When you look at a nearby object, your left eye sees it at a slightly different angle than your right centimeters between our eyes. Once astronomers figured out that the Earth went around the Sun rather than vice versa, they realized that the Earth's orbit made a huge baseline. If we observe a star, when the Earth is at one spot, then wait six months for the Earth to go around the Sun to the opposite side of its orbit and observe the star again, then in principle we can determine the distance to the star, assuming we know the size of the Earth's orbit. That's why distance light travels in a year. Light's pretty fast and covers about 10 trillion kilometers in a year. It's a huge distance, but it makes the numbers easier on our poor eight brains. That makes 61 Signe a much more palatable 11.4 light years away. Astronomers also use another unit called a parsec. It's based on the angle of star shifts over the course of a year. A star the nearer one is by measuring its parallax, you just have to compare its brightness to one farther away to get its distance. You have to make sure that the same kind of star, some are more luminous than others. But thanks to spectroscopy, we can do just that. A star's distance is the key to nearly everything about it. Once we know how far it is, and we can measure its apparent brightness, we can figure out how luminous it is, how much light it's actually nearby stars, and that was bootstrapped using brightness to determine the distances to much farther stars.

The moon is pretty hard to miss when it's up at night. It's big and bright and really very pretty. Even cooler, it's the closest astronomical object in the universe to us and arguably the one we know best. I it's due to two factors, how we perceive the sizes of objects and how we perceive the sky. We don't really see the sky as a hemisphere over our heads, but more like a flattened bowl with the horizon farther away than the zenith. So when the moon's on the horizon The Maria are made of darker, basaltic material, which means they probably formed from lava flooding older areas. For most of human history, the far side of the moon was hidden from us. But in 1959, the Soviet Union flew the Luna 3 space probe around the, roughly 50 million years after things started to settle down. A Mars-sized planet, given the unofficial name Thea, slammed into our young planet. But it wasn't a head-on impact. It was a grazing collision. The impact was colossal, blasting a huge amount of material from both planets into space. Most of it came from the outer layers of the Earth since the collision was a grazing one. This material rapidly coalesced into the moon appears in our sky today. And the Earth was hot. It hung there like a blast furnace and would have seriously heated the near side of the moon. The far side would have been much cooler. The material on the near side would have vaporized and a lot of it would have condensed on the far side. Over time, this created the thicker far side crust we see today. Then there was another seriously terrifying event. The late heavy bombardment, a period of intense collisions more, punctuated with a central peak, a mountain in the middle that formed as material from the gigantic impact that formed it, splashed back up in the middle. Double craters are common too, probably formed when binary asteroids hit the moon. There are also craters near the moon's poles have floors that never see sunlight. Comet impacts can distribute water all over the moon, but most of it is destroyed by sunlight. But it can collect in these dark craters. And studies show there could be over a billion tons of water there in the form of ice. That would be a huge boon to colonization. Water is heavy.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hello and welcome to Crash Course Astronomy. That is Phil Plait, the bad astronomer. And he'll be your host for this series.

Despite these salacious title bright, and so on. The fain of stars, you can see, are the most abundant, vastly outnumbering the bright ones. This is due to a combination of two effects. One is that stars aren't all the same intrinsic physical brightness. Some are dim bulbs, while others are monsters blasting out as much light in one second as the sun does in a day. The second factor is that not all stars are the same distance from us. The farther away a star is, the,000 times brighter than the faintest star you can see. Let's take a closer look at some of those bright stars, like, say, Vega. Notice anything about it? Yeah, it looks blue. And Betelgeuse looks red. Arcturus is orange, cappella, yellow. Those stars really are those colors. By eye, only the brightest stars seem to have color, while the fader ones all just look white. That's because the color receptors in your eye aren't very light-sensitive, and only the brightest stars can trigger them. When we say a star is in the constellation of Ophaiicus, it's because the location of the star puts it inside that constellation's boundaries. Think of them like states in the US. The state lines are decided upon by mutual agreement, and a city can be in one state or the other. Mind you, not every group of stars makes a constellation. The Big Dipper, for example, is only one part of the constellation of Ursa Major, the Big Bear. The bowl of the dipper toward the ground. This lights up the sky, making fainter objects much more difficult to see. That's why observatories tend to be built in remote areas, as far from cities as possible. Trying to observe faint galaxies under bright sky conditions is like trying to listen to someone 50 feet away whispering at you at a rock concert. This affects the sky you see as well. From within a big you look carefully, you might see that a couple of the brightest stars look different than the others. They don't twinkle. That's because they aren't stars. They're planets. Twinkling happens because the air over our heads is turbulent, and as it blows past, it distorts the incoming light from stars, making them a big circle around the center of the earth over a day. But if you move north or south toward one pole or the other, that circle gets smaller. When you stand on the pole, you don't make a circle at all. You just spin around in the same spot. It's the same thing with the sky. As the sky spins over us, just like with the earth, it has two poles and an equator. A star on the celestial equator makes a big circle around the sky, but one so small you'd never notice. By eye, night after night, Polaris is the constant in the sky, always there, never moving. Remember, the sky's motion is a reflection of the Earth's motion. If you were standing on the north pole of the Earth, you'd see Polaris at the sky's zenith, that is, straight overhead, fixed and unmoving. Stars on the celestial equator would appear to circle the horizon once per day. But this also means that stars south of the celestial equator can't be seen from the Earth's north pole.\", 'Astrology'], [\" What is the nature of the universe? How's that for a question? For a long time, we humans had no idea what was going on in the universe. To help, we made up stories to either help us explain what we saw, or to make us feel better about what we didn't understand. But then science came along and we started to understand more. We could test our ideas, and as we got more confident in the process, our ideas grew. The may be born and they may die, but overall things pretty much stayed in balance. The universe always existed, always will, always had galaxies in it, and so on. There are variations on this idea, but that's it in a nutshell, and it's what many astronomers believed. This is important. When we try to understand observations in astronomy, we fit them into a framework of work began to converge. One was by a Belgian theoretical physicist named Georges Lomatre. In the 1920s, he had been studying Albert Einstein's work, the equations dealing with the behavior of the universe as a whole. Einstein had concluded that the universe was static, unchanging, but Lomatre disagreed. He found that an expanding or for every distant galaxy we observe. They are all redshifted, all heading away from us. And this ties into what LaMatra had concluded. The universe is expanding. Wait, what? The universe is getting bigger? How can that be? What does that even mean? There are lots of different ways of looking at this. LaMatra himself suggested imagining the cosmic clock running backwards. Right now, it's time inexorably marches on. All the galaxies in the sky are getting farther and farther away from it. and started transparent. If we look back fars, satellite observations further refined the measurements of this cosmic microwave background, and now it's essentially confirmed. This glow was successfully what's really happening. Remember, I've talked about space being a thing in which matter and energy exists. Space can be warped or bent by mass, creating what we think of as gravity. When we talk about the universe expanding, we mean space itself is expanding, and when it does, it carries galaxies along with it. In a sense, it's like having a rubber ruler. When you pull on it, it gets longer, and the distance between equation showed, and what LeMatre saw in them, space is expanding. But that means the Big Bang wasn't an explosion in some pre-existing space. It was the initial exploding expansion of space itself. The universe isn't expanding into anything because it's all there is. Pretty smart, us apes! Today you learn that distant galaxies show a red shift in their spectra, which means they're moving away from us. The universe is expanding. This means it used to be hot and dense, then it started expanding and cooling. This model of the universe's early behavior is called the Big Bang, and it was confirmed when the background radiation, the glow of the fireball,\", 'Astrology'], [\" As we've seen over the past few episodes, a lot of really epic stuff happens when a star dies. If the star's core is less than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, it becomes a white dwarf, a very hot ball of super-compressed matter about the size of the Earth. If the core is heftier, between 1.4 and 2.8 times the Sun's mass, it collapses even further, becoming a neutron star that's only 20 kilometers across. The neutron's soup quickly and it's gone. It'll never fall back. The Sun, which has much stronger gravity than Earth, has an escape velocity of over 600 kilometers per second. A neutron star with its immense gravity can have an escape velocity of 150,000 kilometers per second. That's half the speed of light. Keep that in mind and let's go back to the collapse in core of the star. As it shrinks, its gravity gets stronger and stronger. That means its escape velocity gets the speed of light, is called the event horizon for that reason. Any event that happens inside can't be known. It's beyond the horizon for us. Black holes mess with our concepts of space and time. The math and physics of black holes is incredibly complex, so much so that even after several decades of study, physicists still argue over a lot of their properties. This has led to a lot of misconceptions about them too. Alright, let's get about gravity, the strength of gravity you feel from an object depends on how massive it is and your distance from its center. The closest you can get to the sun is by touching it, being on its surface about 700,000 kilometers from its center. If you get any closer to its center, you're inside it. The material outside of your position is no longer pulling black holes could form in the centers of galaxies was first proposed in the 1970s, and it wasn't much later that the first one was found in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. We've measured its mass at a whopping 4.3 million times the sun's mass. And now we think every major galaxy has one at its heart, too, and in fact, but narrower than a hair wide. Astronomers call this, and no, I'm not kidding, spiggetification. This would happen pretty close to the black hole, just a few dozen kilometers out. If you fell in from a bowling ball on top of a bed warps the shape of the mattress. The more massive an object, the more it warps space. Not only that, but space and time are basically two parts of this same thing, what we now call spacetime. You can ticking more slowly as you fell in. And this isn't a mechanical or perception effect, it's actually woven into the fabric of space. To someone outside looking down on you, your fall would literally take forever. But then they wouldn't be able to actually see you. The light you emit would have to fight the intense gravity of the black hole to get out. And to do that, it would lose energy. This is very similar to the Doppler Red out. We're still new at this, and struggling to understand what may be the most complex objects in the cosmos. Black holes, as bizarre and counterintuitive as they are, keep popping up from here on out as we poke our noses into more and bigger astronomical objects. While they may seem scary and weird, and let's be honest, they are. They have literally shaped most of the objects we see in the universe. Today you learn that stellar mass black holes form when a\", 'Astrology'], [\" Twinkle twinkle little star. Oh, I know who you are. At first glance, stars pretty much all look alike. Twink Stars are hot dense balls of gas, so they give off a continuous spectrum, that is, they emit light at all wavelengths. However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inter layers. These gases absorb light at specific wavelengths from the light below, depending on the elements in them. The result is that the continuous spectrum of stars, allowing astronomers to understand not just their composition, but also many other physical traits. For example, at the time it was thought that stars had roughly the same composition as the Earth. But Payne-Gaposhkin showed that stars were overwhelmingly composed of hydrogen, with helium as the second most abundant element. The In between there are orange and even some yellow stars. But there are no green stars. Look as much as you want and you won't find any. It's because of the way our eyes see color. A star can put out lots of green light, but if it does, it'll also emit red, blue and orange. And our eyes mix those together to form other colors. A star can actually emit you combine that with knowing a star's distance, things get amazing. You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope. And by using the distance, you can calculate how much energy it's actually giving off. What astronomers call its luminosity. An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it's nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away. By knowing the distance, you can correct for that and figure out a surprise, a very strong trend. This is called an HR diagram after Hertzsprung and Russell. It's not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy. In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom. Hot blue stars are on the left and cool red stars on the right. The groups are pretty obvious. There's that thick line stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence. Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right and so on. The sun is there too, more or less in the middle. What about the other groups? Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue, white, but very faint. That means they must be small, and star is doing with itself. This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky, so much so that they'll be handled separately in later episodes. I'm sorry to tease so much about what's to come, but this aspect of stars, finally understanding them physically, was a major step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more.\", 'Astrology'], [\" The previous episode of Crash Course Astronomy was a bit of a brain stretcher. We saw that the universe is expanding, space is expanding, and it's carrying galaxies along with it. That means it was denser in the past, and at, it will escape. But if you don't throw it fast enough, it'll slow, stop, reverse course, and fall back down. Astronomers fully expected to see this effect on the expansion of space. If you looked on the very largest ofae is that they all occur when the mass of the white dwarf gets to about 1.4 times the mass of the sun. That's the magic number where pressure overcomes gravity and they go kabalui. That makes them good standard candles, objects whose intrinsic brightness, whose luminosity is known. Knowing that is not only expanding, but that expansion is getting faster every day. What could possibly cause such a thing? To be flatly honest, we don't know the universe. Matter has gravity and gravity bends space. So, is there enough matter in the universe to stop the expansion? The geometry of the universe mathematically describes its overall curvature, the shape of space on the largest scales of all. To be answer as far as we can see is, yes, the universe will expand forever. Okay, there's one more brain-melty thing we need to talk about. For this part, you might want to sit down. Space itself is expanding. As light travels from one galaxy to the next, it fights that expansion losing energy, just like you use up from us now. When it emitted that light, the universe was much younger, smaller, and the galaxy closer to us. It would have been about 4.5 billion light-years away at the time, and the light took over 9 billion years to get here. Back then, the space between us and the galaxy wasn right on the edge of the observable universe now, might be visible. But in the future, the space between us and it will have expanded even more. The light can't beat that expansion, and it'll never reach us. The galaxy, over time, disappears. This has awesome videos. This episode was written by me, Phil Plait.

In the last episode of Crash Course Astronomy, I talked about the eventual fate of the sun and other low-mass stars like after a series of expansions and contractions, they blow off their outer layers, become white dwarfs, and fade away over billions of years. The end. Except not so much. First, white dwarfs are pretty awesome objects and worth investigating. And second, when a star becomes a white dwarf, it produces what That might seem like the end of the story, but I skipped a step, and it's a beauty. When helium fusion stops, the Sun's core will have about half the mass of what the Sun does today. The rest will have blown away and a space around it. What remains is basically composed of electrons and carbon nuclei mixed with a small amount of a few other elements. So what kind of an object are we left with here? You may know that light charges repel. Electrons have a negative charge and repel each other. The tighter you squeeze them, the stronger that pressure. A that white dwarf forms, the gas blown off hasn't gotten very far from it, at most a light year or two. That's plenty close enough to get zapped by the white dwarf radiation, causing that gas to glow in response. What does something like that look like? Why? It looks like this! This object is what we call a planetary nebula. It's a funny name, and like so many other names, it's left over from when these objects were first discovered. The astronomer William Herschel, the same man who discovered star. Many planetaries, as we call them for short, are round and look like soap bubbles. Pretty much what you expect when you look at an expanding shell of gas. But with the advent of digital detectors, their fainter structures became clearer, and the true beauty of these phenomenal centrifugal force. The overall shape of the expanding gas is flattened like a beach ball someone sat on. When the fast wind kicks in, it slams into that stuff in the orbital plane and slows down. But there's less stuff nebula is due to the hot central white dwarf exciting the gas. Most of the gas is hydrogen, which glows in the red. However, a lot of the gas is oxygen. And that's why we don't see many. Though there are billions of stars in the galaxy that die this way, this phase is very brief. Enjoy looking at them while you can. And what of the sun? Will it one day in the distant future be at the center of a planetary nebula it expels as it dies? Eww, probably not. When the sun becomes a white dwarf, it most likely won't be energetic enough to make the surrounding gas glow.\", 'Astrology'], [\" You know, if Shakespeare had been an astronomer, he'd have said that there is a tide in the affairs of the universe, and on such a full sea are we now afloat. He would have been right. You might just think of tides as the ocean going in and out every day, but in fact what astronomers call tides are a subtle but inexorable force that have literally shaped most objects in the universe force it will feel. If you or say about 300 kilometers tall, the force of gravity would drop by about 10% at your head. That probably would be enough to notice if you weren't dying from misphyxiation and, you know, being 300 kilometers tall. This change in the force of gravity over distance is what astronomers call the tidal force. When you have a massive object affecting another object with its gravity, its tidal force depends on several factors. For one thing, it depends on how strong the gravity long from head to feet. But the Earth is big! It's nearly 13,000 kilometers across. That means the side of the Earth facing the Moon is about 13,000 kilometers closer to the Moon than the other side of the Earth. This is a pretty big distance, enough for tides to become important. The side of the Earth facing the Moon is pulled harder by the Moon than the other side of the Earth, so the Earth stretches. It becomes ever so slightly football-shaped, like a sphere with two bulges, one pointing toward the Moon and one pointing away. This is probably the weirdest is low, the water's been pulled away from it, and it's low tide. But wait a second, the Earth is spinning slowing of the bulge is actually slowing the rotation of the Earth itself, making But since it does spin once per orbit, we only ever see one face. This is called tidal logging, and it's worked on nearly every big moon in the solar system. Tides from their home planet have matched their spin in orbital period. These moons all show the same face toward their planet. No, wait a second. If the moon has gravity, which causes tides, and is the root cause behind all these shenanigans, what about the sun? It's even bigger than the moon. Tides depend on the gravity from an object and we get spring tides. A week later, the moon has moved around and we get neptides again. Not only that, the moon orbits the Earth on an ellipse. When it's closest to us, we feel a stronger effect. If that also happens at new or full moon, we get an added kick to the spring tides. This is called the Proxigian tide and can lead to flooding in low-lying areas. Unless you live on the coast, I bet you had no idea tides were so complex. Tides are universal. They work wherever there's gravity. If two stars orbit each other, each\", 'Astrology'], [\" This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace. Venus was the Roman goddess of love, and honestly, if you've ever seen from Earth, Venus usually passes above or below the Sun in the skies. It laps the Earth and pulls ahead in its orbit. But again, just like with the Moon, but then don't happen again for over a century. The last pair of Venus transits happened in 2004 and 2012. I was fortunate enough to see both the 2004 and 2012 transits, and they were totally cool. But the next one? December 10th, 21 17. If you missed the last two, sorry about that. Venus is actually so bright sometimes thatic acid too. But it's so hot, the drops evaporate before hitting the ground. Yep. Venus is hell. Why? How did it get so hot? It turns out Venus is a victim of a runaway greenhouse effect. A long time ago, Venus may have been more temperate, and might even have had liquid water oceans. But the sun was cooler when it was younger, and as it aged, it got hotter. At some point, the Venus warmed, and then a cascading series of events led to it being a ridiculously hostile environment due to the runaway greenhouse effect. Even though Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus is way hotter. Given that, the last thing you might expect on Venus is... snow. Well, possibly. Observations show that there's something shiny on the mountaintops, and snow fits the bill, but it's not water ice like on Earth. As the thinking goes, at lower elevations, minerals like Bism it, living on Venus would be really odd. The thick clouds mean it's about as bright as twilight on Earth, despite being closer to the Sun. The thick atmosphere also means surface temperature is about the same everywhere on the planet, pole to a quater. Due to its backwards rotation, the Sun would rise in the West, and due to the slow rotation, its day is actually longer than its year. Calendars on Venus would be a mess. But calendars would probably be the least good shape. They haven't been eroded much. Indicating they aren't terribly old. Not only that, but the erosion we do see seems to be about the same for all these craters, indicating they're all roughly the same age. That's weird. This all points to some sort of catastrophic event that resurfaced the planet roughly half a billion years ago. Any features older than that were wiped out, and then big impacts over time created theonics, slow bubbling leaks of lava from the interior of the planet can continue in one spot for a long time. This creates what are called pancake domes, huge, flat, low domes. Many are dozens of kilometers across, but less than a kilometer high. The lava that formed them was probably really viscous, which is why the domes are flattened and spread out. The searing surface temperature of Venus probably kept the lava hot and helped it spread out more, too. Oh, and one final note.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Stars are in a constant struggle between gravity trying to collapse them and their internal heat trying to inflate them. For most of a star's life, these two forces are at an uneasy truce. For a star like the Sun, the balanced tips in its twilight years. For a brief glorious moment it expands, but then blows away its outer layers, leaving behind the gravitationally compressed core. It goes out with a whimper. Well, carbon will fuse. There are actually a lot of steps in this process. But in the end, you get carbon fusing into neon, magnesium, and some sodium. What happens next? Harkens back to what we found goes on in the Sun's core as it ages. Fuse an element, create a heavier one, then that heavier one builds up until the core contracts and heats up enough to start fusing it. So carbon fusion makes neon, magnesium, and sodium, hydrogen fusion stops. Its core contracts, and then helium fusion begins. It swells up just as the sun will, but instead of becoming a red giant, it generates so much energy, it becomes a red super giant. These are incredibly huge stars, some over a billion kilometers across, and they are luminous. For example, Betelgeuse and fuse elements at far higher rates, running out of fuel more quickly. A star like the Sun can happily fuse hydrogen into helium for over 10 billion years. But a star twice as massive as the Sun runs out of hydrogen in just 2 billion years. A star with 8 times the Sun's mass runs out in only 100 million years or so. And each step in the fusion process happens faster than the one before it. In it fuses, it actually sucks up energy instead of creating it. Instead of providing energy for the star, it removes it. This accelerates the shrinking, compressing the core, heating it up even more. Even worse, at these temperatures and pressures, the iron nuclei suck up electrons that are whizzing around, which are also helping support the core. It's a double whammy. Both major means of support for the can escape. A black hole is born. We'll cover black holes in a future episode as well. But for now, what happens when the core collapses and suddenly stops? The core of the star, whether it's a neutron star or a black hole, is now extremely small with terrifyingly strong gravity. It pulls on the star's matter above it. Hard. This stuff comes so dense that a huge number of them are absorbed. This vast wave of neutrinos slams into the oncoming material like a bullet train hitting a slice of warm butter. The material stops its in fall, reverses course, and blasts outward. The star explodes. It explodes. This is called a supernova, and it is one of the most violent and terrifying events the universe can offer. An entire star that might explode in this way is Spica in Virgo, and it's well over 100 light years away. I say might explode because it's at the lower mass limit for going supernova. It might not explode at all. Beetlejuice will certainly explode someday, but it's too far away to hurt us. We're pretty safe from this particular threat. I'll note that after all this, there is another kind of supernova involving white dwarfs, which we'll cover in our episode aboutnovae are how the majority of heavy elements in the universe are created and scattered. The calcium in your bones, the iron in your blood, the phosphorus in your DNA all created in the heart of the titanic death of a star. That star blew up more than five billion years ago, but parts of it go on in you. Today you learn that massive stars fuse heavier elements in their cores than lower mass stars. This leads to the creation of heavy\", 'Astrology'], [\" Over the past few weeks, I've talked about our sun, the planets, and other objects in our solar system. Stars, both big and small, brown dwarfs, exoplanets, supernovae, and clouds of gas and dust. What do all these things have in common? Well, they. We all live in the same town. It's a big town, and it's called the Milky Way Galaxy. Let's cut to the chase. The Milky Way Galaxy is a vast, flat, disk- constellations of Sagittarius and Scorpius are visible, you'll notice the stream broadens there, forming a bulge apparently bigger than your outstretched hand. This glows resemblance to a pathway or river is strong, and many ancient cultures saw it that way as well. Because it glows a dull white, the ancient Greeks called it Galaxius, or Milky. Over the millennia, being in a smoky room where you can't see the walls. It looks like the room is smaller than it really is, and you look like you're in the center, even if you're near one of the walls. Globular clusters were a good clue that there was more going on. These spherical balls of stars orbit the galaxy well outside the main body of the galaxy itself. There are more of them on one side of the sky than the other, which you wouldn't about a thousand light-years before dust blocks everything behind it. But with the advent of radio astronomy, we figured that out too. Star-forming gas clouds emit a very narrow wavelength range of radio waves, and this could be used to measure their Doppler shift how quickly they were moving toward or away from us. Making a few other basic assumptions, their rough distance could be found as well. An amazing result was found. The locations of these with heavy traffic on it. For some reason, one car slows down a little. The car behind it slows, and the car behind that one hits the brakes too. It's like a wave that moves backwards through traffic, slowing everyone down. Where they slow down, they tend to clump up too, so you see more cars and trucks in the jam. The funny thing about traffic jams is, they tend to persist for a long time, even as cars move out of them. The car at the front might slow transient. However, there's more to it. A nebula entering a spiral arm might hit another one already in there, a cosmic fender bender. But when that happens, the nebula can collapse, forming stars. Some of them are massive, luminous, blue, and hot. These stars are very easy to spot at great distances, making the galaxy spiral arms look blue. They also light up the gas around them, accentuating the spiral arms. Spiral arms are where the majority the star birth in there happened long ago, and ceased when the gas ran out. Unlike the spiral arms, where stars are still actively being born, all the blue stars in the bar are long dead, exploded, leaving behind billions of lower mass, redder stars. The bar is probably about 20,000 light-years long. This odd structure is due to the weird gravity of the galactic disk. Unlike our solar system, where any stars we do see would be old. It's possible some stars in the halo form there, while others were flung out into the halo after collisions with other stars and clusters. Speaking of which, most of the globular clusters orbiting the Milky Way are in the halo. There are more than 150 in total. So there you have it, our local galactic town. But like any denizen of a small town, it's natural to wonder if this is all there is. What else is out there? And at the beginning of the 20th century,\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hey folks, Phil Plait here, and for the past few episodes, I've been going over what we know about the structure, history, and evolution of the universe, and how we know it. Now it's time to put that into action. We can use this knowledge of physics, math, and astronomy to figure out what the universe was like in the past, going all the way back to literally the first moment after it was born. So, here you go, a brief history of the universe. In the early universe comes from experiments done in giant particle colliders. When the cosmos was very young and very hot, particles were whizzing around at high speeds and slamming into each other, creating other subatomic particles in the process. That's exactly what colliders do. The higher energy we can give our colliders, the faster we can whack particles together, and the earlier the phase of the universe we can investigate. That's one of the main reasons why we keep making them bigger and more powerful, give them more energy, and the atoms whizz around faster and faster. Heat them to millions, or billions of degrees, and the atoms themselves fall apart. They collide so violently, they can overcome the hugely strong forces holding their nuclei together, and you get a soup of subatomic particles, electrons, neutrons, and protons. Heat them more, and even protons and neutrons will a phase change. The very nature of reality was changing. Its laws and behavior different. At some point, we go so far back, so close to that first moment in time, that our laws of physics, well, they don't break down so much as say, here be dragons. We just don't understand the rules the core of a star. But it's at those temperatures that nuclear fusion can occur. For a few minutes, the particles smashed together, forming deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, helium, and just a smattering of lithium. A little bit of beryllium was made as well, but it was radioactive and rapidly decayed into lithium. Then at T plus 20 minutes, the universe cooled enough that fusion stopped. When it did, there good at absorbing photons, absorbing light. When the universe was still ionized prior to recombination, it was opaque. A photon couldn't get very far before an electron sucked it up. But after recombination, the photons were free to fly. The universe became transparent. Why is this important? Because the light emitted at this time is what we see of the sky, you're seeing it coming from opposite ends of the universe. Even back then, those regions of the universe were separated by vast distances and had plenty of time to go their separate ways, change in different ways. They should look pretty different, but they don't. As telescopes got better, very tiny variations in the light were found, but they were really teeny, only a factor of 1 in 100,000. In other words, one part of the sky may looketime, causing it to swell enormously. Inflation explains why the universe was so smooth at the time of recombination. Space expanded so rapidly that any lumps in it were smoothed out, like pulling on a bed sheet to flatten out the wrinkles. Inflation explains several other problems in cosmology as well. And although the details are still being hammered out, the basic idea is almost, pardon the expression, universally in the first place. Are there more universes out there hidden away where we can't see them? If time and space started in the Big Bang, does it even make sense to ask what came before it? Or is that like asking what's north of the North Pole? We don't know the answers to these questions, and trust me, there are thousands more just like them. But here's the fun part. We might yet be able to answer them. After all, even asking if the universe had a beginning, let alone what happened between then and now, was nuts.\", 'Astrology'], [\" We live in a pretty cool neighborhood, the Milky Way galaxy. We're out in the suburbs, sure, but it's still an interesting place, buzzing with activity. Stars, nebulae, stellar clusters of various sorts, the occasional supernova. It's a happenin' place. In the earliest part of the 20th century, astronomers were just starting to figure this all out. But there were a handful ofer-Kurdis was of the opinion that we were one of many galaxies. It wasn't a debate as such, more of a presentation of ideas, and there was no clear winner. Both sides had fragmentary data, and we now know, some shaky observational evidence that turned out not to be correct. For example, Chappley noted that one of the spiral nebul Milky Way. They also resolved swarms of faint stars, cinching the fact that the great Andromeda nebula was actually the Andromeda galaxy. At that moment, our understanding of the universe swelled in size, and we've never looked back. We've learned a lot about galaxies in the ensuing century or so. Each is a collection of at least hundreds of millions,ppy or patchy arms. These are called flocculate spirals resembling tufts of cotton. Some spirals have wide flung arms while others are tightly wound. Spirals take on wildly different appearances depending on their angle to us. Some we see face on, and these may be the most magnificent objects in the entire sky. shaped like cigars or American footballs. They tend to have no overall structure as spirals do. Ellipticals are puffy, and they range in size dramatically. Some are what are called dwarf ellipticals just a few thousand light years across to monsters that hugely out muscle our own Milky Way. Besides their shape, we're talking about distances of tens of thousands of light years here. In the early stages of the collision, tidal effects can be strong. Stars on the side of the galaxy near the other one get pulled toward it more strongly than the stars farther away, so the galaxies can get stretched and long tendrils of stars and gas get drawn out. Generally, collisions aren't head-on, but more of a side swipe, so there's some sideways motion. When that happens, the tidal streamer can become curved up into vast, sweeping orbits. The results, so we think, are elliptical galaxies. Not all collisions result in galaxies becoming ellipticals. If a big spiral collides with of collisions. Their shapes distorted so much that the structure was lost. Smaller ones may then the sun, and then the galaxy. But every time we investigate these situations earnestly and engage in honest debate, we find that we're smaller and farther removed from the action than we thought, or than we thought we deserved. Astronomy is really, really good at putting us in our place. But it's also really good at showing us just how grand and awe-inspiring that place is. Today, we learn that the Milky Way is a galaxy.\", 'Astrology'], [\" The Sun is a star. That's a profound statement, and one that's not really all that obvious. Those little sparks in the night sky are pretty, but don't look anything at all like the hot blazing orb that lights up our days. It was a pretty remarkable intellectual leap to understand the sun and the stars are just different flavors of the same kind of object. The only difference is that the sun is close, but the stars are terribly far away, so they're f. The pressure is a crushing 260 billion times the Earth's atmospheric pressure, and it's a searing 15 million degrees Celsius. Under those conditions, hydrogen is completely It's equivalent to detonating 400 billion one megaton nuclear bombs every single second. That's millions of times the entire nuclear arsenal of our planet every second. And that's why, even from a distance of 150 million kilometers, the sun is so bright, you can't even look at it. Even from that point, the energy from inside the Sun is free to travel into space. It's this light that we see when we look at the Sun. The Sun is a gas and doesn't have a solid surface, but the gas in the photosphere thin so rapidly compared to the Sun's huge size that you can think of it as the Sun's surface. And there's one final layer above that. The ethereal thin corona, sort of like the Sun's atmosphere. It's less fly away into the universe as a much lower energy photon of visible light. So how long does this process take? I've seen different numbers for it, some as much as a million years. But a lot of those calculations don't model conditions inside the Sun accurately. For example, they don't take bar magnet when it affects iron filings on a piece of paper. The solar magnetic fields are like that, except there can be zillions of them all over the sun's surface, where they can interact and even get tangled up. When the plasma reaches the surface, it cools. But if the magnetic loops tangle up, they prevent the plasma from sinking back down into the sun, like a fiery arches. We think these magnetic field lines are feeding energy from the sun's surface into the corona, which is why it's so much hotter. It's not exactly clear how this happens, but scientists are following several leads right now. This long-standing mystery may soon be solved. Magnetic fields on the sun also have a huge amount of energy stored in them. You can of debris can hit the Earth, and when it does, there can be profound effects. Our atmosphere absorbs the high-energy light, protecting us. Also, the subatomic particles are generally deflected by the Earth's magnetic field, so we're okay. But, if conditions are right, the Earth's magnetic field can interact with the particles. Massive numbers are funneled down into Earth's atmosphere near the poles, causing the air to glow. This is what we call Sun is so important. We depend on it for light and heat and the very basis of life itself, but it's entirely capable of knocking our society to its knees. Understanding it is critical to our future. The Sun is the two octillion ton gorilla in the room. We need to respect that. Today you learn that the Sun is a star powered by nuclear fusion in its core. Hot plasma moves inside the Sun, creating magnetic fields, which in turn can create sunspots, solar flares, and corona.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Sometimes in science, the story of how we learn something is just as cool as what we learned. In the case of gamma ray bursts, it's kind of hard to beat the awesomeness of what they are. But of all the plot lines in astronomy, their origin launch nuclear weapons. You could lob bombs on the enemy within minutes instead of needing the better part of an hour using ballistic missiles. Fear of this, as much as anything else, drove the writing of the event looked completely different than that. There was a strong, sharp peak of emission lasting less than a second, followed by a longer weaker pulse lasting for several more seconds. A quick look at solar flare data revealed no activity that day that could generate gamma rays either. Weird. Over time, more and more of these mysterious bursts of gamma rays were found. As analysis techniques got better, it and other objects nearby were candidate progenitors of the detected bursts. It didn't narrow things down at all. It's like telling someone you dropped a quarter and you want help finding it. When they ask you where you dropped it, you reply, Wyoming? As more of these objects were found, it was seen that they really were occurring on random points in the invisible. In 1997, that hope became reality. The Dutch Italian satellite Beppo Sax had launched the year before, designed in part to look for transient flashes of high-energy light and nail down their positions. In 1997, it detected a gamma ray burst and was able to get a reasonably decent location for it in the sky. Within hours, ground-based telescopes pinpointed the position, and time were inadequate to explain the ferocity of a gamma ray burst. Unless astronomers came up with an idea. What if the energy blasting outward from a supernova were focused somehow? In a supernova, the energy gets flung out in all directions, expanding as a sphere. If instead that energy could be collected and sent out as a beam that could explain the bursts. We now understand this to need fancy equipment to see them either. On March 19th, 2008, a GRB erupted into view, and its distance was quickly determined to be 7.5 billion light-years from Earth. Despite that ridiculous distance, it got so bright that if you had happened to be looking at that part of the sky, you would have seen, it's weird. Relativity is like that. But think of it as a slow leak in the orbits, very gradually dropping the neutron stars together. Over billions of years, the and do the same amount of damage. But there's an upside to those beams. Because they're so narrow, we can only see a burst if the beam is aimed right at us. That means we miss most of them, so the actual rate of GRBs is much higher in the universe.

A few centuries ago, that gap bugged astronomers. They really wanted there to be a planet in there. On the first day of the 19th century, January 1st, 1801, they got their wish. Kinda? Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi found a point of light, moving at just the right speed to be the desired planet. But has accelerated over the years, and now, today, we know of hundreds of thousands. There are probably billions. Yes, billions of them, larger than 100 meters across in the solar system, and over a million larger than 1 kilometer in size. So what are we dealing with here? What are these asteroids? There's not really a hard and fast definition of what's an asteroid and what isn't. But generally speaking, it's a class of smaller bodies that are rocky out of that orbit. The resulting gap is called the Kirkwood Gap, and there are several such asteroid deserts, all with simple multiples of Jupiter's period. In this way, the main belt is like Saturn's rings, whose gaps are carved out by the gravity of the orbiting moons. Another way to group asteroids is by orbit. Some have similar orbits and may have formed from a bigger parent asteroid that got disrupted by an impact. These groups are called families But we do know a rubble pile. Individual rocks held together by their own gravity, like almost all of them apart, though, and that's why we see asteroids with different compositions. Some are from the denser core, others from the lighter crust skies, looking for them. This is a pretty important topic, and I'll go into it in more depth in a future episode. There's another category of asteroid that exists due to the sun ahead of Earth. There are also asteroids that have orbits that are very similar to Earth's, but are slightly elliptical and tilted with respect to ours. Because of this, they can stay relatively near the Earth in space, but don't really orbit us. Instead, they sometimes get closer and sometimes recede. It's pretty weird, but a natural outcome of orbital mechanics. Some people say these asteroids are moons of Earth, but it's better to say they're co-orbital with us. Only a few are known, the most famous late. Must be coincidence.\", 'Astrology'], [\" Hey, astronomers, Phil Plait here. In our last episode, I talked about galaxies, vast collections of gas, dust, and upwards of hundreds of billions of stars. We live in one, the Milky Way, a gigantic disk galaxy with sprawling spiral arms. Other galaxies are elliptical, or irregular, or peculiar. But those are classifications based on shape. We from being some dim thing, 3C273 revealed itself to be the most luminous object in the universe ever seen at that time. It blasts out over four trillion times the energy the sun does. And yet it appears star-like, a mere dot in the sky. Because of this, it was dubbed a quasi-stellar radio source, which is pretty underwhelming for the most powerful energy source in in their cores. In fact, one of the reasons the Hubble Space Telescope was built and launched was to explore this idea and characterize that is, find out as much as it could about these black holes. Over time, we've found this idea is absolutely correct. Every big galaxy we see appears to have a huge black hole in its heart. Even the smallest is a monster with millions of times the sun's mass and some tip the cosmic scale at billions of the blocks the intense highest energy light. But we do see lots of infrared, as the radiation from the disc heats up clouds of dust around it. If the accretion disk is tipped a bit to our line of sight, we see more optical and high energy light from it. And if the poles are aimed right at us, all that ridiculously energetic ex- and gamma ray light can be seen. The Milky Way has a supermassive black hole in its heart, too of a small knot of galaxies we call, in long-boring astronomical nomenclature tradition, the local group. It consists of a few dozen galaxies, most of which are small and dim. So faint that we're still discovering them. Two galaxies completely overpower the group, the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. The local group is elongated, almost dumbbell-shaped, with the Milky Way The Earth may still be around when talking about the galaxy itself. But those distances are as nothing when you start talking about intergalactic trips. We're about to venture out into the greater universe, and galaxy sits right at the very center. This is probably the result of collisions between smaller galaxies. When they smack into each other, their velocities through the cluster tend to cancel out, like two cars hitting head on and stopping. So they fall to the center. As more mass falls to the center, the galaxy there grows huge. As mind-boggling as this all is, we're not done. Surveys of the sky have revealed that not empty of galaxies called voids. This cosmic large-scale structure, its size, shape, distribution of matter, and more, holds clues to some of the biggest questions we can ask.

World War I wasn't the most destructive war, or the first total war, and it certainly wasn't, despite its billing, the war to end all wars, but it was the war to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army, Germany, because it had an alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France, because, you know, France. War helped define who was them and who was us, and doing that strengthened the idea of us. And before World War I, war was perceived to be necessary and often even glorious. The trench warfare on the western front is most famous for its brutal futility, Great Britain and France on one side, Germany on the other, with no man's land in between. World War I was a writer's war and there's a lot of metaph we get to a silver lining. The war itself was incredibly destructive. Over 15 million people were killed and over 20 million wounded. In France, 13.3% of the male population between the age of 15 and 49 died in the war. The war also saw a lot of civilians die, especially in the Ottoman Empire, where more than 2 million of the 3 million people killed were non-combatants. But like so many other wars, World War I's most efficient killer was,000 men in the first day of fighting. Remember the old colonialist verse, whatever happens, we have got the Maxim gun and they have not? Yeah, well, now everybody had machine guns. One of the things we try to remember here to distress them. According to German officer Ernst Junger, it was not danger, however extreme, that depresses the spirit of men, so much as over-fatigue and wretched conditions. And for most soldiers, especially the British and a person. And for millennia, you've played an important role in war, often helping soldiers do their duty, often distracting them from it. But here's the thing, alcohol, in my experience, which is extensive. If you need to be drunk to do something, you should maybe not do the thing. Unless, of course, the thing is golf. Best wishes, John fight a civil war that wouldn't end until 1922. This might have helped Germany too, except the US entered the war on the side of the British and the French, which led to another outcome of the war, increased geopolitical influence for the US.

Think of Hemingway's The Sun also rises, which is about a man rendered not noble but impotent by war.

Yeah, about the test. The test will measure whether meat, then freeze it, and ship it to its destination. You also gotta grow some wheat and then process the living crap out of it until it's whiter than Queen Elizabeth the first. Then you gotta milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese. And forager peoples have noted that they actually spend a lot fewer hours working than the rest of us, and they spend more time on art, music and storytelling. Also, if you believe the classic thousand calories of work to create a thousand calories of food. And it was impossible to create large population centers, but if you have a surplus, agriculture can support people not directly involved in the production of food. Like for instance, trades people who can devote their lives to better farming equipment, which in turn makes it easier till the land on your behalf, which is the kind of non-ideal social order that tends to be associated with agricultural communities. So why did agriculture happen? Wait, I haven't talked too long to breed. Which reminds me, it's time for the open letter. Elegant. But first, let's see what the secret compartment has for me today. Oh, have argued, people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce more alcohol. Charles Darwin, like most 19th the way, because A, surprisingly caloric, B, they're easy to carry since they come with their own suitcases, and C, to imprison them, you just have to scratch a ditch around their living quarters. That's not really a revolution, that's just people trying to increase available calories. But one non-revolution leads to another, and pretty soon you have this, as far as the eye can see.

USS R. Not a Country. Rhodesia. South Vietnam. Sudan with no South Sudan. Yugoslaviaomans in 1878. In India, where a political party, the Indian National Congress, was founded in 1885 and even in China, where nationalism ran up against a dynastic system that had lasted more than 2000 years. And then of course, there are these guys, who in many ways represent the worst of nationalism. The nationalism that tries to deny or eliminate difference in the efforts to create a homogenous, mythologized, unitary polity. We'll get to them later, but it's helpful to bring them up now, just to formalize their connections. Others argue that nationalism is constructed by governments, building a sense of patriotism through compulsory military service and statues of national heroes. Public education is often seen as part of this nationalizing project. Schools and textbooks allow countries to share their nationalizing narratives. Which is why the once and possibly future independent nation of Texas issues textbooks literally whitewashing early American history. New Yorkers, or Pennsylvaniaians. I mean, our antebellum nation was usually called these United States, after it became the United States. So in the US, nationalism pulled the nation together, but often nationalism was a destabilizing force for multi-ethnic land-based empires. This was especially the case in the Ottoman Empire, which started falling apart in the 19th century as first the Greeks, then the Serbs, Romanhead, to grant him the title of Shogun. And for the next 260 years or so, the Tokugawa Bakuufu was the main government of Japan. The primary virtue of this government was not necessarily its efficiency, or its forward-thinking policies, but its stability. Stability, the most underrated of governmental virtues. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The Tokugawa Bakuufu wasn't much for centralization, a wake-up call to see the dominant power in the region so humbled, but even worse for the Tokugawa was the arrival of Matthew Perry. No, thought bubble, Matthew Perry. Yes, that one. The Tokugawa are't give up without a fight, but the civil war between the stronger Daimyo and the Bakufu eventually led to the end of the Shogunate. And in 1868 the rebels got the newly enthroned Emperor Magi to abolish the Bakufu and proclaim a restoration of the Imperial throne letting me borrow your graduation hat. Dear public education, when you were introduced in Japan, you were very unpopular because you were funded by a new property tax. In fact, you were nationalism began to appear early on. In 1869, the Meiji rulers expanded Japan's borders to include the island of Hokkaido. And in 1879, they acquired Okinawa after forcing its king to abdicate. In 1874, Japan even invaded Taiwan with an eye toward colonizing it, although they weren't successful. And in these early actions, we already see that nationalism has a habit of thriving on conflict. And often, the project of creating a nation-state goes hand-in-hand with preventing others from doing the same.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green and this is Crash Course beautiful morning.

The Empire's European states formed in the 19th century proved about as stable and long-lasting as Genghis Khan's, leading to so many of the nation states we know and of European imperial experiment. But in all those cases, empires struck back. You see what I did there? I mean Britain lost its 13 colonies, but later controlled half of Africa and all of India. And what makes the recent decolonization so special is that at least so far, no empires have emerged to replace the from this to this. So we're going to oversimplify here because we have to, but decolonization throughout Afro-Eurasia had some similar characteristics. Because it occurred in the context of the Cold War, many of these new nations had to choose between socialist and capitalist influences, which shaped their futures. While many of these new countries eventually adopted some form of democracy, the road there was often rocky. Also, decolonization, he stands out for his use of non-violence and his linking it to a somewhat mythologized view of Indian history. I mean, after all, there's plenty of violence in India's past and in its heroic epics, but Gandhi managed to harken back to a past that used non-violence to bring change. Gandhi and his compatriot, Jawaharl Nehru, believed that a single India could continue to to end its colonization of India were non-violent, the emergence of the independent states involved really wasn't. Thanks Thought Bubble. All this violence devastated Gandhi, whose lengthy and repeated hunger strikes to end violence had mixed results, and who was eventually assassinated by a of India's emerging global capitalism next week. For now, though, let's travel east to Indonesia, a huge nation of over 13,000 islands that has largely been ignored here on Crash Course World History due to our longstanding bias against islands. Like, we haven't even mentioned Greenland on this show. The Greenlanders, of course, haven't complained because they don't have the internet. So the Dutch exploited their island colonies with the system of the Khmer Rouge, which massacred a stunning 21% of Cambodia's population between 1975 and 1979. In Vietnam, the French bought Communist-led nationalists, especially Ho Chi Minh, from almost the moment World War II ended until 1954 when the French were defeated. And then the Americans heard that. The best known example is in Rwanda, where two very different tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsis, were combined into one nation. But more generally, the colonizers' focus on value extraction really hurt these new nations. Europeans claim to bring civilization and economic development to their colonies, but this economic development focused solely on building infrastructure to get resources serving dictator Robert Mugabe was a high school teacher.

You're purportedly free markets only make slaves of us all. Oh God, Stan, it's me from college. Me from the past has become me from college. This is a disaster. The reason he's so unbearable, Stan, is that he refuses to recognize the legitimacy of other people's narratives and that means that he will never ever be able to have a productive conversation with another human in his entire life. So listen to me from the past. I'm gonna disappoint you by being two capitalists and's 1200 CE and you're a rug merchant. Just like merchants today, you sometimes need to borrow money in order to buy the rugs you want to resell at a profit and then you pay that money back often with interest once you've resold the rugs. This is called mercantile capitalism and it was a global phenomenon from the Chinese to the Indian Ocean Trade Network to Muslim merchants who would sponsor trade caravans across the Sahara. But by the 17th century, merchants in focusing on the robot instead of me? I am the star of the show! Stan, but you're going behind the globe. So when most of us think about capitalism, especially when we think about its downsides, long hours, low wages, miserable working conditions, child labor, unemployed stands, that's what we're thinking about. Now, admittedly, this is just one definition of crops like clover that added nitrogen to the soil and could be used to feed livestock at the same time meant that more fields could be used at once. This increased productivity eventually brought down prices, and this encouraged further innovation in order to increase yield to make up for the drop in prices. Lower food prices had an added benefit since food costs less and wages in England remained high, workers would have more disposable income, which meant that want more cheaper food. Yeah, well, not so fast. One of the ways the British achieved all this agricultural productivity was through the process of enclosure, whereby landlords would reclaim and privatize fields that for centuries had been held in common by multiple tenants. This increased agricultural productivity, but it also impoverished many tenant farmers, many of whom lost their livelihoods. Okay, for our purposes, capitalism is also a cultural system, is the exorbitant appetite of men, which they will take pain to gratify. So wrote John Kerry, one of capitalism's cheerleaders in 1695, and in talking about our appetites, he wasn't just talking about food. That doesn't seem radical now, but it sure did back then. So here in the 21st century, it's clear that industrial capitalism, at least for now, has branches of socialism in France, utopian and revolutionary. Utopian socialism was often associated with Comte de Saint-Simone and Charles Fourier, both of whom rejected revolutionary action after having seen the disaster of the French Revolution. Both were critical of capitalism, and while Fourier is usually a punchline in history classes because he believed that in his ideal socialist world, the seas would turn to lemonade, he was right that human beings have been the secret compartment today. terms. Marx is thinking is deep and dense and we're low on time, but I want to introduce one of his ideas, that of class struggle. So for Marx, the focus isn't on the class, it's on the struggle. Basically, Marx believed that classes don't only struggle to make history, but that the struggle is what makes classes into themselves. The idea is that through conflict, classes develop a sense of themselves, and without conflict, there is no such thing as class consciousness. So Marx was writing in 19th century England, and there were two empowerment pretty quickly, the idea of protecting our collective interest remains powerful. That's where we'll leave it for now, lest I start reading from the Communist Manifesto. But ultimately, socialism has not succeeded in supplanting capitalism as its proponents had hoped. In the United States, at least socialism has become something of a dirty word. So industrial capitalism certainly seems to have won out, and in terms of material well-being and access to goods and services for people Danko and our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

His birth was somewhat miraculous, requiring a surgical procedure that we know today as a Caesar-E-In section. Coming as he did from the senatorial class, it was natural that Caesar would serve in both the army and Gaul and his four loyal armies, or legions, as the Romans called them, became his source of power. Caesar continued his conquests invading Britain and waging another successful war against the Gauls. While he was away, Krasis died in battle with the Parthians and Pompey, who had become Caesar's rival and enemy, was elected consul. Pompey and the Senate decided to try to strip Caesar of his command and then bet on Mark, I am the wrong horse, Antony, instead of Emperor. There is a baby attached to my leg, Augustus. But before all that, Caesar made his way back from Egypt to Rome, stopping off to defeat a few kings in the east on his way, and was declared dictator again. That position was later extended for 10 years,, changed his name to Caesar Augustus, became sole ruler of Rome, attached to baby to his leg, adopted the title Emperor, and started printing coins identifying himself as Divenophilius, the son of God. More on that next week. Although Augustus tried to pretend that the forms of the Roman Empire were still intact, the truth was he made the laws and the Senate had become nothing more than a rubber stamp. Which get me wrong, Roman Senate. You were terrible. Best wishes, John Green. So did Caesar destroy the Roman Republic? Well, he started a series of civil wars, he seized power for himself, he subverted the ideas of the Republic, he changed the Constitution, but he's only really to blame if he was the firstins and the Etruscans and pretty soon they had all of Italy under their control. But that's not really diversity of subject peoples. I mean nothing personal Italians but you know you have a lot of things in common like the constant restrictions.

So this is a t-shirt. It was designed in Belgium and contains cotton from both Brazil and Texas, which was turned into cloth in China, stitched in Haiti, screen-printed in Washington, sold to me in Indiana, and now that I am too fat to wear it, it will soon make its way to Cameroon or Honduras in Africa and Eurasia as we will see today. Let's go straight to the Thought Bubble. As previously mentioned, the Silk Road was not a road. It's not like archaeologists working in Uzbekistan have uncovered a bunch of yield signs and baby-on-board stickers. It was an overland route where merchants carried goods for trade. But it was really two routes. One that connected the Eastern Mediterranean to Central Asia, and one that went from Central Asia to China. Further complicating export, silk was mostly used for clothes. Silk clothing feels light in the summer and warm in the winter, and until we invented $700 pre-distressed designer jeans, decking yourself out in the wake of that, the Eugei migrated to Bactria and started the Cushon Empire in what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan. Although Silk Road trading began more than a century before the birth of Jesus, it really took off in the second and third centuries CE, and the Cushon Empire became a huge hub for that Silk Road trade. By then, nomads were being eclipsed by professional merchants who traveled the Silk Roads, often making huge profits. But those cities that had been founded by Silk Road came to have a lot of political clout and in some ways that began the tension that we still Road? Ideas. For example, the Silk Road was the primary route for the spread of Buddhism. When we last saw the Buddha's eightfold path to escaping the cycle of suffering and desire that's inherent to humans, it was beginning to pray for the success of trade missions and the health of their patrons. It was win-win, especially when you consider that one of the central materials used in Mahayana Buddhist rituals is silk. And the third reason the Silk Road changed all our lives. Worldwide interconnectedness of populations led to the spread of disease. Measles and smallpox traveled along it, as did bubonic play.

So this is a Roman coin from around the time Jesus was born in the Roman Empire, and it calls Augustus the Emperor the Son of God. So let's just state at the outset that in 4 BCE, being the Son of God, or at least being the Son of A God, was not such an unusual thing The idea of the covenant, a deal with God. The main man in this, the big mocker, was Abraham. Not to make this too much of a scripture lesson, but it's kind of hard to understand the Jews about understanding Abraham, or Abram, having always existed, and he is deeply personal. He chats with prophets, sends locusts, etc. But he doesn't take corporeal form like Greek and Roman gods do. He is also involved in history, like he will destroy cities and bring floods and determine the outcome of wars and possibly football games. Stay on note, football games! Probably most important to us today and certainly empire. Unless you are, wait for it, the Mongols. Or the Persians. Also, they were Hellenizers bringing in Greek theater and architecture and rationalism. And in response to those Hellenistic influences, there were a lot of preachers trying to get the Jews to return to the traditions and the godly ways of the past, including the Sadducees and untrue. We're not going to discuss Jesus' divinity, because one, this isn't the theology class, and two, flame wars on the internet make me so uncomfortable that I have to turn to camera two. Hi there, camera two. I'm here to remind you that three fighting over such things, like fighting over whether the proverbial cake is a lie, rarely. So some religious Jews saw Jesus in those prophecies and came to believe either during his life or shortly thereafter that he was the Messiah. Most of them thought the new everlasting kingdom was right around the corner, which is probably why no one bothered to write down much about the life of Jesus for several decades, by which time it was clear that we might have to wait a bit for this brilliant new everlasting kingdom. I should know, by the way, that the idea of had destroyed the temple and expelled the Jews from Judea, beginning what we now know as the Jewish diaspora. And without a temple or geographic unity, the Jews had to solidify what it meant to be a Jew and what the basic tenets of the religion were. This forced the followers of Jesus to make a decision, were they going to continue to be Jews following stricter laws set forth by rabbis, or were they going to be something else? The decision to open up their religion to non-Jews, people who weren't part of the secret compartment today. Oh, Stan! It's my favorite album, Jesus Christ Superstar, finally available in my favorite format, the cassette. Did I color coordinate my shirt to Jesus Christ Superstar? Yes. Dear Ickthiss, so check this out. In the first century, when it was still super underground and hipster to be a Christian, you were a secret symbol of Christianity used to kind of hide by the Roman Empire, and sometimes fed to the lions and other animals, the religion continued to grow, albeit slowly. But then as the Roman decline continued, Emperor Constantine allowed the worship of Jesus, and then eventually converted to Christianity himself. And then the religion really took off.

Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, which situation? Oh, me from the past. I forgot you wanted to go to Columbia. Me from the present regrets to inform you that you do not get in. But since you live in the past, you have no way of knowing who I'm talking about, and it occurs to me that this video may be although these days historians are less likely to do that because they recognize that one man's great is generally another man's terrible. And also the Great has some misogynistic implications. Like it's almost always men who are called the Great. You never hear of Cleopatra the Great or Elizabeth the Great. Sure, there's Catherine the Great of Russia, but for her masculine greatness, she was saddled with the completely untrue rumor that she are women. For another, and this is important, there are lots of historical events that no one can take responsibility for. Like, for instance, the Black Plague. Still, Alexander was accomplished. I mean, he conquered a lot of territory. Like, a lot. His father, Philip, became important dynasties, the Antigonids in Greece and Macedonia, the topomies in Egypt, the Solusids in Persia, all of which lasted longer than Alexander's empire itself. A second kind of greatness, maybe Alexander was great because he had an enormous impact on the is now Afghanistan with pictures of their kings, with the word king, written beneath the pictures in Greek. This is also why, incidentally, the New Testament was eventually written in Greek. Although Alexander was mostly just comical pursuits of glory and heroism are accompanied in classical histories by stories of Alexander walking through the desert and it's suddenly raining and these ravens coming to lead him to the army he's supposed to fight. And stories of his hot Persian wife Roxanna, who will be a whole chapter exploring the exploits of great men and then at the end there will be one sentence that's like also women were doing stuff at the time and it was important but we don't really know what it was.

This is Crash Course World History and today we're gonna return sadly for the last time on Crash Course to China. By the way, Stan brought cupcakes. Oh, good. I wish I could draw some parallel between this and China if I got nothing. They're just delicious. I'll sure miss you piece of felt Danica cut out in the shape of China using blue because we felt like red would be cliche. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green! You don't get to talk until you shave the mustache me from the past. So the 20th century was pretty big for China because it's at least not until recently. Instead, China experienced the disastrous anti-Western boxer rebellion of 1900, which helped spur some young liberals, including one named Sun Yat Sen, to plot the overthrow of the dynasty. Oh, it's already time for the open letter? An open letter to Sun Yat Sen. Now, but first let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh. More champagne poppers. Stan, at this point the revolutionaries were like, we're probably gonna be outed, so we should just start the uprising now. The uprising probably would have been quelled like many had before, except this time the army joined the rebellion because they wanted to become more modern. The Qing emperor abdicated and the rebels chose a general, Yuan Shikai, as leader, while Sun Yat Sen was declared president of a match made in hell, well, yes, it was. That said, the two did manage to patch things up for a while in the early 1920s, you know, for the sake of the kids. But then Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, and the Communists were winning over the peasants in their northwestern enclave by making sure that troops didn't pillage local land and giving peasants a greater say in local government. Now that isn't to say that everything was rosy under Mao's communist industry, and lots of freedoms. Including freedoms of thought, speech, publication, assembly, association, correspondence, person, domicile, moving from one place to another campaign actually died, but capitalism was weakened and state-controlled bolstered. Okay, let's backyard to increase steel production. This was not a good idea. First off, it didn't actually increase steel production much. Secondly, it turns out that people making steel in their backyard who know nothing about making steel make bad steel. But the worst idea was to pay for heavy machinery from the USSR with exported grain. This meant that there was less for peasants to eat and as a result, between 1959 and 1962, 20 million people died, probably half of whom were under the age of 10 to consolidate Mao's revolution. And while his image still looms large, it's hard to say that China these days is a socialist state. Many would argue that Mao's revolution was extremely short-lived, and that the real change in China happened in 1911. That's when the Chinese Republic ended 3,000 years of dynastic history and forever broke the cyclical pattern the Chinese had used to understand their past.

The Haitian revolutions are totally fascinating, and they involve two of my very favorite in a sugar production colony was exceptionally brutal. In fact, by the late 18th century, more slaves were imported to San Dominga every year, more than 40,000, than the entire white population of the island. By the 19th century, slaves made of the wealthier ones eventually owned plantations and slaves of their own. And then below them on the social ladder were the poor whites, or the petite blanks who worked as artisans and laborers. And at the bottom were the slaves, who made up the overwhelming majority. I know what you're thinking. This is a recipe for permanent social stability. No, it wasn't. Okay, so when the French Revolution broke out in 1789't get to sell your children to other corporations. And two, as you're about to see, slaves did revolt. So the unrest in what became Haiti started in 1789 when some slaves heard a rumor that the King of France had freed them. Even though it was across the ocean, word of the changes in France reached the people of Haiti, where the Declaration thrilled about this, and that led to fighting breaking out between them and the newly French free people of color. And then in August of 1791, the slaves were like, um, hi, yes, screw all of you. And a massive slave revolt broke out. Among the leaders of this revolt was Toussaint and citizenship for every slave in the French Caribbean. But emancipation didn't end the story because the French were still at war with the Spanish and the English in San Domingue. Luckily for France, Louvertour was an excellent general and luckily for the people of the island, Louvertour was also an able politician, he needed tons of money from France's most valuable colony, Sandomenga. And the best way to maximize profits? Why to reintroduce slavery, of course. That's certainly what the former slaves thought was the plan, when in 18 1-Me, 2-Yellow chair, 3-The-Chalkboard, 4-Danica, 5-Mare-The-Enterne, 6-You-Stand-You're 6! Oh, I'm mad.

It also affirmed to quote from the book Slave Revolution in the Caribbean, a broad definition of the new country as a refuge for enslaved peoples of all kinds. So why is this little island so important that we would devote an entire episode to it? First, Haiti was the second free and independent nation state in the Americas.

Mr. Green, fracking? You don't know about Battlestar Galactica yet, me from the past? Oh, man, there are so many great things in your future. Today I'm going to try to show you how tiny Spain's influence spread around the world and shape the lives of almost every human on the planet, generally in negative ways. I know, everything is such a bummer on Crash Course recently. Guatemala and the Yucatan, and they demanded tribute from conquered people in the form of goods, precious metals, and people to sacrifice. If you're familiar with the Hunger Games, it won't surprise you to learn that this didn't sit very well with said conquered people. And the fact that the Aztecs were basically ruling over thousands of people who hated them made it a lot easier for Cortez to come in and find allies to overthrow them. All that noted in less than 100 years, the Azteleck was in, what was that called Stan? Asteroid. Asteroid. Armageddon. Armageddon. Armageddon. Right. Like that. Human sacrifice. Best wishes, John Green. Alright, now let's head south to the Inca civilization, which was older than the Aztecs, and in some ways even more impressive, founded in the 13th century, the Inca Empire ruled between four and six million people by the time the Spanish showed up in 1532. Trade and a very effective administrative structure held the empire together were perfect for Spanish conquest. Their administrative structures were similar, there was a similar link between secular and religious power, albeit different religions. All of which made it relatively easy for the Spanish crown to step into the void left by those two great empires and send their own administrators to run the place. While most of the Spanish aristocrats who came over ran large agricultural operations, you don't see a lot of movies called like Indiana Jones and The Search for a Nice Farm in the Country Bubble. Spain's holdings in the Americas and in Europe and in the Philip Nada coincidences. He also inherited a rebellion in the Netherlands because the Dutch were like, we're gonna be Protestant. Also, you guys know nothing about economics, which incidentally the Dutch are still saying to the Spanish. And then the English sided with the Dutch and there was a war featuring a disastrous invasion of England called the Spanish Armada in 1588. England's success against the Spanish, even though it can largely be chalked up to weather, was credited to Queen Elizabeth I. That led to a period of wealth and national pride, which meant that people producer of consumer goods until the 19th century that they ran out. So they went to silver. Now China didn't have a lot of silver itself, but Japan did, so they traded manufactured goods for it. But soon even that wasn't enough. This was mostly because in the 16th century China changed its tax structure. Taxes, man. They're at the center of human history. In the early part of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese farmers paid their taxes in goods, mainly grain and labor. But as more silver entered the economy, been used for. The Spanish Empire's silver trade was the first truly global market. Even India was involved, but were really out of time. And its consequences were dire, even if it did make some people rich. Both Spain and China experienced inflation that weakened their governments. The environment suffered.

Wait, are they still a thing? So we used to put information on thinly sliced trees, and then you would pay someone to they aren't. First off, there were several empress downagers who wielded tremendous power throughout Chinese history, and there was one very important full-fledged empress, Empress Wu, who ruled China for more than 20 years and founded her own freaking dynasty. And those emperors keep ruling, the dynasty, which was the dynasty that built the Great Wall and made amazing vases, but didn't save them from falling to the Manchus, who founded a dynasty that was called the Qing, which was the last dynasty because of a ruler, and therefore, Heaven saw fit to come in, remove the mandate, and allow the Shang to take power. But then the Shang lost the mandate. Why? Well, the last Shang Emperor is reported to have roasted and eaten his opponents, which, you know, bit of a deal-breaker, can imagine, the making of that particular omelet required the cracking of quite a few eggs, and the great chin emperor Chin Shwongdi and his descendants developed a reputation for brutality that was justified. But it was also exaggerated for effect so that the successor dynasty, the Han, would look more legitimate in the eyes of heaven. He spent a great deal of his time trying to convince one of the powerful kings to embrace his system, but while none ever did, Confucius got the last laugh because his recipe for creating a functioning society was ultimately adopted and became the basis for Chinese government, education, and, well, most things. So Confucius was conservative. He argued that the key to bringing about a strong and peaceful state was to look to the past and the model of the sage will act respectively. Ultimately, the goal of both father and son is to be a superior man, Chun-Z in Chinese. If all men strive to be Chun-Z, the society as a whole will run smoothly. This idea applies especially to the emperor who is like particularly the sage-emperors. The study of history as well as poetry and paintings in order to understand and appreciate beauty is indispensable for a chunzi. The other important aspects of chunzi-ness are contained in the Confucian ideas of Ren and Li. Ren and Li are both incredibly complex concepts that are difficult to translate, but we're gonna do our best. Ren is usually a more modern historian might point out that the negative effects of terrible storms and floods, which include peasant uprisings, sometimes lead to changes in leadership.

Maybe foods that are already delicious do not need the added benefit of being pleasingly were lords of estates, not their wastoral kids. But more importantly, that analysis ignores religious motivations. We've approached religions as historical phenomena, thinking about how for instance the capricious environment of Mesopotamia led to a capricious cadre of Mesopotamian gods. But just as the world shapes religion, religion also shapes the world. And some modern historians might ignore religious motivations, but medieval crusaders sure as hell didn't. I mean, when people came up with that id remarkably, some would say, miraculously successful. By the time they arrived in the Levant, they were fighting not against the Seljuq Turks, but against Fatimid Egyptians, who had captured the Holy Land from the Seljuks, thereby making the Turks none too pleased with the Egyptians. At Antioch, the Crusaders reversed a seemingly hopeless situation, when a peasant found the spear that had pierced Christ's side, hidden under a church, thereby raising morale enough to win the most important kings in Europe answered the call.

So they decided to go by boat, which necessitated the building of the largest naval fleet Europe had seen since the Roman Empire. The Venetians built 500 ships, but then only 11,000 crusaders actually made it down to Venice because like, oh, I meant to go, but I had a thing come up, etc. There wasn't enough money to pay for those boats, so the Venetians made the crusaders a deal. Help us capture the rebellious city of Z killed, and raped Christians as they went, stole the statues of horses that now adorn St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice, and retook exactly none of the Holy Land.

No. Instead, it would jitomized the idea that crusading didn't have to be about pilgrimage, that any enemies of the Catholic Church were fair-gained.

So traditionally historians are pretty keen on wars because they feature clearly delineated beginnings and middles and ends and because they always have a fair bit of death and drama and mortally wounded generals who have great last words like, let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of those trees. Whereas the last words of plague victims are always like, uhhhhhh... do there. That's all you get, Europe! So the Seven Years War lasted for anyone? Anyone? 23 years? I hate you, me from the past. But as it happens, by sheer coincidence, you are not necessarily wrong. So the when. The they were like, JIN OF A PALLONGLY! Thank you for years of high school French. Anyway, the war wasn't really about land. It was really about our old friend trade. The British wanted to expand into the American interior to allow for more colonists because the British benefited both from the export of sided with both the British and the French, but as a broad generalization, Native Americans were more likely to support the French. Up to this point, shrewd Indian tribes had been able to play the British and the French off each other and maintain a degree of autonomy for themselves. And as long as the French were present, the British were prevented from encroaching too much on lands Native farming were so different from European agriculture. So the French, and especially the English, just assumed that the Indians weren't improving the land, which meant that they didn't own the land, so that meant that it was okay for Europeans to take it. As you might imagine, that was problematic for the Indians. In general, Indian tribes initially got along better with the French than with the Dutch or English because, one, the French did not settle in large numbers as they were mostly traders were fighting there too because you know, why not? The British attacked a French at a trading post called St. Louis, well Stan don't make me say it right, fine. St. Louis and at a town called Gore, both in Senegal. Why? Well, trade of course. Senegal was the main source of gum arabic, which is notable for many reasons, but most importantly it is a key ingredient in the Diet Coke and Mentos phenomenon. So of course the British British press exaggerated the numbers in order to build support for the war in India. Not the last time that exaggerations of enemy brutality would be used to gin up support for a war. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the military campaigns in this part of the world is that at least initially they were not undertaken by governments themselves, but by corporations that had their own armies. The British East India Company was the thereafter, the British had effective control over trade in Bengal, and the French were excluded from it. This was an incredibly valuable region because it produced silk and inexpensive cotton cloth for export, and it gave the British a decisive advantage over the French and eventually allowed them to control all of India.

So by now Stan, cancel everything and get me on the phone with the Discovery Channel! One last thing about wars, they are expensive. In 1756, the British national debt was 75 million pounds. In 1763, it was 133 million pounds. Someone had to pay for this, and the British felt it was only fair that the American colonists should foot the bill.

Well, it turns out the colonists weren't so keen on this. Not so much because the tax was high, but because they had no direct representation in the Parliament that had levied the tax. And plus, they were cranky about the crown keeping large numbers of British troops in the colonies, even after the end of the Seven Years' War. And then the British government was like, you are inadequately grateful and the colonists were like, shut up, we hate you. And the British government was like, as long as you live under our roof, you live by our rules and so on. Dear tea, like all Americans who love justice and freedom, I hate you. But I understand you're quite popular in the UK, where the East India Company would periodically go to war for you. But what fascinates me about UT, I mean aside from the fact that people choose to drink you when there are great American refreshments available like Mountain Dew, is that even though you're stereotypically English, you're not English. It's Chinese or Burmese or Indy no one really knows drafting and approving the Declaration of Independence. No, it's all about the Will Smith Vehicle Independence Day. I mean the Declaration of Independence, right? That one. It's not your fault. You guys are Canadian. You've never declared independence. Worth noting, by the way, that the Congress edited out more Britain ended slavery well before America did and, you know, without a civil war. Also, even though most Americans had come to see themselves as separate from Britain before 1776, the British certainly didn't see it that way. They continued to fight either until 1781 or 1783, depending on whether you calculate by when they actually gave up or when the peace treaty was signed. So you can't really say the American Revolution was won before the fighting even started exchange for the right to own and use it. And that's very different from taxation systems dating all the way back to like Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. And it's probably not a coincidence that most of the writers and signers of the Declaration of Independence were men of property. And they wanted to keep it that way. So basically the white guys who controlled the land and its production before the American Revolution were the same white guys who controlled it after the American Revolution. And this leads us to the second and more important way that as a revolution of mind? Did it change the way we think about what people are and how we should organize ourselves? Addressing those questions will involve a brief foray into the history of ideas. Let's study the Enlightenment! The Enlightenment was primarily a celebration of human's ability to understand and improve the natural world through reason. The Enlightenment had a number of antecedents, including the European Renaissance and the scientific revolution, but what made it special was that some of its more radical proponents, like Immanuel Kant, for instance, went changes. America made sure that there would never be a formal nobility except for the Count of Chocula, and it recognized the equal rights of daughters and widows when it came to inheriting and possessing property. It also created a world in which future countuses could rehabilitate their reputations in New York. But the real seismic change was that after the Revolution, Americans came to view themselves as equal to each other. And in the, because the people executing those ideas will never be ideal.

And the Emperor's successors weren't as interested in maritime trade. They were more concerned with protecting China against its traditional enemies, nomads from the steppe. To do this, they built a rather famous wall. The Great Wall was mostly built under the Ming Dynasty, using resources that they only had because they stopped building gigantic ships. And just imagine what might have happened if the Ming emperors had embraced a different strategy, one that was based on outreach instead of isolationism. And now to the blue corner representing Portuguese exploration the Indian Ocean. In 1498 he landed at Calicut, a major trading post on India's west coast, and when he got there, merchants asked him what he was looking for. He answered with three words. Gold and Christians. Which basically sums up Portugal's motivations for exploration. So once the Portuguese breached the Indian Ocean, they didn't create, like, huge colonies because there were already powerful empires in the region. Two, Columbus never thought he'd made it to China. He called the people he encountered Indians because he thought he'd made it to the East Indies, what we now know as Indonesia. And three, Columbus was not a lucky idiot. He navigated completely unknown waters primarily by using a technique known as dead reckoning in which you, we'll just keep it. It's all the same to you. Anyway, line of demarcation, I have great news for you. What Alexander the Sixth did? Totally worked. We haven't had a problem since. Best wishes, John Green. So Columbus's first journey, he made four, the last three of which were pretty calamitous, was tiny. And he initially landed on a small Caribbean island for you, Australia. So who is the greatest mariner of the 15th century? Well, as usual, it depends on your definition of greatness. If you value administrative competence over ill-advised adventure, then Zheng Ha is certainly the winner. But the reason we remember Columbus over him or Vasco da Gama is that Columbus' voyages had a lasting impact on the world, even if it wasn't necessarily a positive one. And that makes me wonder what kind of person you'd want to be.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're gonna talk about Africa. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, we've already talked about Africa. Egypt is in Africa, and you haven't shut up about it the entire course. Yeah, that's true me from the past, but Africa's big. It's like super big, much bigger than it appears on most maps, actually. I mean, you can fit India, and China, and the United States, if you just fold in Maine. All of that fits in Africa. Like any huge place, Africa is incredibly diverse, and it's a mistake to focus just on Egypt. So today, let's go here, south of the Sahara Desert. But here you are, listening to me talk! Well first, it tells us that there were African kingdoms ruled by fabulously wealthy African kings. Which undermines one of the many stereotypes about Africa, that its people were poor and whibbed in tribes ruled by chiefs and witch doctors. Also, since Mansa Musa was making the Hajj, we know that he was A. Muslim and B. Relatively devout. And this tells us that Africa, or at least Western Africa, was much more connected to the parts of the world we've been talking about than we generally are led to believe. Mansa Musa knew all about the places he was going before he got there, and after his visits, the anyway, the Berbers were early converts to Islam, and Islam spread along those pre-existing trade routes between North and West Africa. So the first converts in Mali were traitors who benefited from having a religious, as well as a commercial connection to their trading partners in the North and the rest of the Mediterranean. And then the kings followed the traitors, maybe because sharing the religion of more established kingdoms in the North and the East would give them prestige not to Ibn Batuta. I wonder what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, there's to be some kind of fake beard. Movie magic! Stan, why did you do this to me? Dear Ibn Batuta, bro, I love Twitter and my Xbox and Hawaiian pizza, but if I had to go into the past and live anyone's life, That's not fair. SHUT UP AND TAKE BACK SELINE DION! enough to found these great cities. Now scholars recognize that all the major Swahili cities were founded well before Islam arrived in the region, and that in fact trade had been going on since the first century CE. But Swahili civilization didn't begin its rapid development until the 8th century when Arab traders arrived seeking goods that they could trade on the vast Indian Ocean network, the Silk Road of the Sea. And of course those merchants brought Islam with them, which just like in West Africa was adopted by the elites who wanted religious as well as commercial connections to the rest of the past. And each of those lenses may show us the past as if through some funhouse mirror, but if we're conscious about it, we can at least recognize the distortions. Studying Africa reminds us that we need to look at lots of sources and lots of kinds of sources if we want to get a fuller picture of the past. If we relied only on written sources, it would be far too easy to fall into the old trap of seeing Africa as backwards and uncivilized. Through approaching it with multiple lenses, we discover a complicated, diverse place that was sometimes rich and sometimes not. And when you look at it that way,\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today things gonna get a little bit confusing because we're gonna talk about revolution and independence in Latin America. It's a bit confusing because one Latin America is big. Two, it's very diverse. Three, Napoleon makes everything complicated, and four, as we've seen in the past, sometimes revolutions turn out not to be that revolutionary. basically get up to whatever. This was mainly about property rights because illegitimate children could inherit their father's property, but it was constructed to be about, you know, purity. To get a sense of how patriarchy shaped Latin American lives, take a gander at Sorwana Inez de la Cruz, whose name I deal of racial diversity and a rigid social hierarchy to match. There were four basic racial categories, white, black, mestizo, a mix of white and American Indian, and mulatto, a mix of white and black. We try not to use that word anymore because it's offensive, but royal court decamped to Brazil. And it turned out they loved Brazil. King Joao loved Brazil so much off-topic, but do you think that J. Wow named herself after King Joao? I mean, does she have that kind of historical sensibility? I think she does. So King Joao's life in Rio was Right, so even when Napoleon wasn't forcing Portuguese royals into an awesome exile, he was still messing with Latin America. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So Latin America's independence movements began not with Brazil, but in Mexico, when Napoleon put his brother on the Spanish throne in 1808. Napoleon wanted to institute the liberal principles of the French Revolution, which angered the ruling elite of the peninsularis in whatizo, he didn't gain much Creole support, so revolutionary fervor in Mexico began to fade until 1820, when Spain, which was now under the rule of a Spanish rather than a French king, had a real liberal revolution with a new constitution that limited the power of the church. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So in the wake of Spain's liberalizing movements, the by 1811 had formed a revolutionary junta that seized power in Caracas and formed a republic. But the interior of Venezuela was home to mixed-race cowboys called Yaneros, who supported the king. They kept the Caracas revolutionaries from extending their power inland, and that is where Simone Bolivar, El Libertador enters the picture. Bolivar realized that the only way to overcome the various class wonder if his hips swivel when I wind him up. Context is everything. They do. Hey there cowboy. Here's Simone Bolivar. First, you had fantastic mutton shops. This is if you're some kind of handsome Martin Van Buren. You were a man of immense accomplishments, but those accomplishments have been richly rewarded. I mean this is pretty remarkable, especially when you consider that most of this territory had been under Spanish or Portuguese control for almost 300 years. The most revolutionary thing about these independence movements were that they enshrined the idea of so-called popular sovereignty in the New World. Never again would Latin America be under the permanent control of a European power, and the didn't extend voting rights to women until 1955. Also, Latin America's Revolutionary Wars were long and bloody. 425,000 people died in Mexico's war for independence. And they didn't always lead to stability. Venezuela, for instance, experienced war for much of the 19th century, leading to as many as a million deaths. And it's important to note that fighting for freedom doesn't always lead to freedom.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History, and today we're gonna talk about the Cold War, which actually lasted into my lifetime, which means that I can bore you with stories from my past like your grandpa does. When I was a kid, they made us practice hiding under our desks in the event of a nuclear attack, because, you know, school desks are super good at repelling radiation. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, remember in elementary to get you. Now of course we've seen a lot of geopolitical struggles between major world powers here on Crash Course, but this time there was the special added bonus that war could lead to the destruction of the human species. That was had more money and power and could provide Europe protection what with its army and one of a kind nuclear arsenal while Europe rebuilt. The USSR had to rebuild itself and also they had the significant disadvantage of being controlled by noted ass-hat Joseph Stalin. I will remind you it's not cursing if he's wearing an ass for a hat. Oh I guess it's time for the open letter. An open letter to Joseph Stalin. But, let's go to the Thought Bubble. Europe was the first battleground of the Cold War, especially Germany, which was divided into two parts, with the former capital Berlin also divided into two parts. And yes, I know the western part was divided into smaller occupation zones, but I'm simplifying. In 1948, the Soviets tried to cut off West Berlin by closing the main road that led into the city, but the Berlin airlift stopped them. And then in 1961, the nuclear arsenals were so big that the US and USSR agreed on a strategy appropriately called MAD, which stood for mutually assured destruction. Thanks, Thought Bubble. And yes, nuclear weapons were and to overthrow the leftist government. In El Salvador, the US bolstered authoritarian regimes that were threatened by left-wing guerrillas. The United States ended up supporting a lot of awful governments, like the one in Guatemala, which held on to power through the use of death squads. Frankly, mostly the Warsaw, Pak nations, China and Cuba. The third world was everyone else, and we don't use this term anymore because it warms together a hugely diverse range of countries. We'll talk more about the specific economic and development challenges faced by the so-called third world countries, but the big one in terms of the Cold War was that neither the US nor the Soviets wanted any of these countries to remain neutral. Every nation was supposed to pick sides, either capitalist or communist, and no one likes suffering the humiliation of driving a U-Go. But why the Cold War ended when it did is one of the most interesting questions of the 20th century. It probably wasn't Ronald Reagan bankrupting the Soviets, despite what some politicians believe. The USSR had more satellite states that it needed to spend more to prop up than the US had to invest in its allies. And the Soviet system could never keep up with economic growth in the West. But probably the individual most responsible for the end, the same year mass demonstrations led to elections in Czechoslovakia. In 1993, that country split up into Slovakia and the Czech Republic, the happiest and most mutually beneficial divorce, since Cher left sunny. Of course, sometimes the transition away from communism was violent and painful. In Romania, for instance, the communist dictator, Chiescu, held on to power until he was tried and put before a firing squad at the end of 1989, and it took until 1996 for a non-communist government to take power there.\", 'History'], [\" Hi there, my name's John Green, and this is Crash Course World History. Today we're gonna talk about Egypt. No, not that. Egypt. Older. Older. Older. Less fictional. Yes! That one. Ancient Egypt is probably the most influential of the River Valley civilizations. Like, you may not recognize any Assyrian kings or Assyrian language, but you probably do know King Tut, and you may recognize that the mean, for the test. Oh, me from the past. Remember how you spent all of third year French writing notes back and forth to that girl and she eventually agreed to go out with you and you did make it to second base but now you can hardly parl ummo de français? Historical lenses are like that, my friend. With every choice, something is gained and something is lost. Right, so in discussing agriculture and early river valley civilizations, we've been approaching history through the lens of resource distribution and geography. And just as the violent and in that. reigning over Heliopolis, but he eventually became really central to the entire pantheon of gods in ancient Egypt. He was the god of the sun, but also the god of creation. And the thinking was that if humans did their jobs, then the pantheon of gods would maintain cosmic order. And since the pharaohs became gods upon their death, it made sense to please them, even unto pyramids. Egyptian popular religion also embraced the belief in amulets and magic and divination, and the the star of which was Ammon, which means hidden. So here's a little lesson from history. Hidden gods tend to do well because they're omnipresent. So Ammon eventually merged with Ra to form the god Ammon Ra, who was like the best god ever, and all the Middle Kingdom pharaohs made temples for him and devoted all of their surplus to his glory. The Middle Kingdom also developed an interest in conquering, specifically the New Pharaohs was Hetshepsut, a woman who ruled Egypt for about 22 years and who expanded Egypt not through military might but through trade. But most New Kingdom Pharaohs, being dudes, focused on military expansion, which brought Egypt into conflicts with the Assyrians, who you'll remember from last week, and then the Persians, and then Alexander the Great, and finally the Romans. On the whole, Egypt probably would have been better off enjoying its geographical isolation and An open letter to King Tut. in 1322 BCE, 1200 years later. That's 5 and a half Americas, but because Egypt was so similar for so long, it all tends to blend together when we imagine it. Ancient Egypt lasted a thousand years longer than Christianity has been around and 800 years longer than that other super long lived civilization, China. So there was an entire culture that lasted longer than Western civilization has existed, and it had run its course before the West was even born. Next week we'll be looking\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're gonna talk about Russia, which means we get to talk about this guy again. We haven't talked about Russia much so far, because one, it's complicated, and two, yeah, actually, Governor Ewparski a little bit, because I had some Russian in college, and that makes it difficult to mispronounce things, which is my thing. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, why'd you take Russian? Well, because I had this big crush on a Russian major who founded Kiev. And these guys showed up and replaced them. By that time, the Rus had been at war with pastoral nomads for centuries from the Khazars to the Pechenag to the Cumans, and they were tired. Which made them easy targets. The period of Mongol rule over Russia is also known as Apinidge Russia. And Apinidge is a Princeton, and this period basically featured a bunch of Russian princes vying for control over territory, which is not a recipe for political stability or economic growth. Another theme that will re-emerge in Russian history. By the way, I'm describing all of this as Russia, not really Mongol either since they hated the Mongols and generally believed that the Mongols were a scourge sent from God to punish them for their sinfulness and everything. But the Mongols did help propel Moscow to prominence, and of the 14th century, one of Moscow's princes, the Mietri Donskoy, made war on them and inflicted the first major defeat of Mongols in Russia at the Battle of Kool Cross-eyed. But then Basil the Cross-eyed's brother tracked down Basil the Second, and he was like, I'm applying you back! And of course everybody thought that would end Basil the Second's political career, but they were wrong! It turns out you can rule Russia like a boss, even if you're blind. Best wishes, John Green. After Basil the Blind came the real man who expanded Moscow's power, Ivan the Third, later known as Ivan the Great. Firstly power and the beginning of the autocracy that Russia is famous for, but in the beginning he was really an innovative leader. As a young king he worked with a group of advisors called the chosen council, which certainly sounds like a good thing. He also called the very first meeting of the Zemsky-Sabor, a grand council of representatives similar to the estates general that would become so important in France 200 years later, and he reformed the army, emphasizing the new, except with no resistance. One historian called it a civil massacre. In the end, Ivan the Terrible established absolute control of the Tsar over all the Russian people, but he also set the precedent of accomplishing this through terror, secret police, and the suspension of law. And that would echo through the ages of Russian history. I mean, until Vladimir Putin heroically put an end to it. His little eyes. They're scary. So hence the stereotype of Russian brutality and barbarism, but here's the truth. The rest of Europe also knew a lot about brutality and secret police\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today is the penultimate episode of Crash Course. We're gonna talk about globalization. This was gonna be the last episode, but I just can't quit you, world historian. So today we're gonna talk about globalization, and in doing so, we're gonna talk about why we study history at all. Oh, oh, Mr. Green! Yes, me from the past? We study history to get a good grade, to go to a good college, to get a good job. So you can make more money than you would otherwise make, and be a slightly larger cog among the seven billion gears that turn the planet's economic engine, right? And that's fine, the scale of this trade has increased dramatically. One, multinational corporations have global reach and increasing power. Two, travel and shipping are cheap and safe. It took about two months to cross the Atlantic in 1800. Today, it takes about five hours by plane and less than a week by ship. Three, governments have decreased tariffs and regulations on international trade, leading to what is sometimes called euphemistically free trade. To which I say, if this trade is so free, how even China. And then the finished shirts, called blanks, are usually sent to Europe or the United States for screen printing and then sold. You would think the most expensive part of this process is the part where we ship this across the Pacific Ocean, turn it into this, and then ship it back across the Pacific Ocean. But you'd be wrong. Wholesale T-shirt blanks can cost us little as $3. The expense is in the printing, the retail side of things, and paying the designer Revolution episode that industrial Western powers produced most of the manufactured goods which were then sold in international markets. But you'll also remember that domestic consumption was extremely important. I mean, almost all early model teas were built by Americans and bought by Americans. But since the 1960s, it crumbles up and then it just falls out of your mouth. But here's what fascinates me, Cookie Monster. I believe you when you say you love cookies. It doesn't matter that you can't actually eat cookies because where you would have a stomach, you instead have someone's arm. And that Cookie Monster is what makes you a beautiful symbol for contemporary consumption. You just keep eating, even though you can't eat. Cookie Monster, you are the jump on the cell or betori globalization bandwagon, let's acknowledge that this brave new world has some side effects. For instance, it maybe hasn't been so good for families, it definitely has not been good for the environment, and also there's a chance that globalization will spark like the end of the human species. But we're gonna talk about all that next week. For today, let never been greater. Bollywood movies, Swedish hip hop, Brazilian soap operas, highlights from Cong that does include shipping. By the time it arrives at your door, the cotton within that t-shirt will have travelled by truck, train, ship, possibly even airplane if you opt for priority shipping, and it will probably have travelled further than Magellan did during his famous circumnavigation of the globe. You get all that for three hours of work! By contrast, a far less comfortable garment several hundred years ago would have cost you ten times as much work. But these improvements have been accompanied by change so radical that we can remember both what we've gained and lost in getting to where we are. Next week, our last week, we'll look at the many facets of globalization that aren't causes for celebration. But for today, let's just pause to consider how we got from here to here, how the relentless and unquenchable ambition of humans led to a world where the entire contents of the library of Alexandria would fit on my iPhone, along with recordings of everything Mozart ever composed.

But, one thing, it's much less narrative, but also it's the written record of the revelations Muhammad received, which means it's not written from the point of view of people. It is seen as the actual word of God. The Quran is a really broad-ranging text, but it returns again and again to a couple themes. One is strict monotheism, and the other is the importance of taking care of those less fortunate than you. The Quran says of the good person spends his substance, however much he himself may cherish it, upon his near the month-long fast during the month of Ramadan in which Muslims do not eat or drink or smoke cigarettes during daylight hours. Since Ramadan is a lunar calendar month, it moves around the seasons and obviously it's most fun during the winter when the days are shorter and least fun during the summer when days are both long and hot. Fourth is Zakat or almsgiving in which non-poor Muslims are required to give a percentage of their income to the poor. And lastly, Hajj, the not to be a reverend, but some of it is like middle school gossip. Like Rachel told Rebecca that her sister's brother's friend kissed Justin Bieber on the face. And the vast majority of Muslims don't treat terribly sourced hadiths as scripture. And the idea that you go to heaven and get 72 virgins is not in the Quran. It's in a terribly sourced hadiths, so it is my great regret Although come to think of it, in the end the Mecca and pilgrimage business turned out just fine. So the Quraysh force Muhammad and his followers out of Mecca in 622 CE and they headed to Yathraab, also known as Medina. This journey, also known as the Hijra, is so important that it marks year zero in the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad's son-in-law, to lead the community, and although he did become the fourth caliph, that initial disagreement to radically oversimplified because we only have 10 minutes began the divide between the two major sects of Islam, Sunni and Shia. And even today, Sunni Muslims believe Abu Bakr was rightly elected the first caliph, and Shia Muslims believe it should have been Ali. To Sunnis, the first four caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, are knownyads, as the dynasty that would rule over an ever-expanding Islamic empire for more than 100 years. It's common to hear that in these early years Islam, quote, spread by the sword, and that's partly true. Unless you are, wait for it, the Mongols. Actually, as usual, the thing was legit.

No, you've purportedly smart globe. We're gonna talk about Mesopotamia! I love Mesopotamia because it helped create two of my favorite things, writing and taxes. Why do I like taxes? Because before taxes, the only certainty was death. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, did you know that you're referencing Mark Twain? I'm not referencing Mark Twain, me from the past. I'm referencing Benjamin Franklin, That was my best blue steel. That was as close as I can get. So anyway, if you lived in a city, you could be something other than a shepherd. And thanks to this proto-socialism, you could be reasonably sure that you'd eat. Stan, is there any way we can get another globe in here? I feel like this shot is inadequately globed. Yes, much better. You know, you can tell the quality of the historian Mesopotamia is no Indus Valley with its on-scheduled flooding and easy irrigation. A lot of slave labor was needed to make the Tigris and Euphrates useful for irrigation. They're also difficult to navigate and flood unpredictably and violently. Violent, unpredictable, and difficult to navigate. Oh, Tigris and Euphrates, how you remind me of my college girlfriend. So how do we know that these kings were scootally pooping with lady priests? Because they made a scootally pooping tape and put it on the internet. No, because there's a written record! Mesopotamia gave us writing, specifically a form of writing called cuneiform, which was initially created not to woo lovers or whatever, but to record transactions. Like, how many bushels of period in Mesopotamia entered around 2000 BCE, probably because drought and a shift in the course of rivers led to pastoral nomads coming in and conquering the environmentally weakened cities, and then the nomads settled into for taking an eye should be having an eye taken. Hammurabi's law code can be pretty insanely harsh. Like if a builder builds a shoddy building and then the owner's son dies in a collapse, the punishment for that is the execution of the builder's son. The kid's like, that's not fair, I'm just a kid, what did I do? You should kill my, you seem better than the last guy. Well, that was the case until the Assyrians came along anyway. The Assyrians have a deserved reputation for being the brutal bullies of Mesopotamia. But the Assyrians did give us an early example of probably the most important and durable form of political organization in world history, and also Star Wars history, the Empire. So the biggest problem with empires is that by definition, the Neo-Acereans, whose divine regent was the king. Asher, through the king, kept the world going, and as long as conquest continued, the world would not end. But if conquest ever stopped, the world would end, and there would be rivers of blood and weeping and gnashing of teeth. You know how Apokolipses go. The Assyrians spread this worldview with propaganda, like monumental architecture and readings about making administration impossible. But more importantly, when your whole worldview is based on the idea that the apocalypse will come if you ever lose a battle and then you lose one battle, the whole worldview just blows up. That eventually happened, and in 612 BCE, the city of Nineveh was finally conquered and the Neo-Assyrian Empire had come to its end. But the idea of empire was just getting started.

Where Europe, the Prime Meridian, runs through us, we're in the middle of every map, and we get to be a continent even though we're not a continent. But let's begin today with a pop quiz. What was the best year of your life, and what was the worst year? Mr. Green, Mr. Green Ages actually weren't that bad, at least until the plague came in the 14th century. And meanwhile, outside of Europe, the Dark Ages were truly an age of enlightenment, but we'll get boring Europe out of the way first. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Medieval Europe had less trade, fewer cities, and less cultural output than the original to people's safety were also small-scale and local. But of course, this system reinforces the status quo. There's little freedom and absolutely no social mobility. Peasants could never work their way up to lords, and they almost never left 100 years. The Umayyad dynasty then expanded the Empire west to Spain and moved the capital to Damascus because it was closer to the action Empire wise but still technically in Arabia. That was really important to the Umayyads because they'd established this hierarchy with the Arabs like them at the top and in fact they triediph's rule was a lot more indirect, just like the original Persians. This meant that his control was much weaker, and by about 1000 CE, the Islamic caliphate, which looked so incredibly impressive on a map, had really descended into a series of smaller kingdoms, each paying lip service to the caliph and Baghdad. This was partly because the Islamic Empire relied more and more on soldiers from the frontier, in this case the Turks, and especially the physician Galen, and they translated and preserved Buddhist and Hindu manuscripts that might otherwise have been lost. Muslims made huge strides in medicine as well. One Muslim scholar Ibn Sina wrote the canon of medicine, which became the standard medical textbook for centuries in both Europe and the Middle East. And the Islamic Empire adopted mathematical concepts Nothing gold can stay. Best wishes, John Green. Baghdad wasn't the only center of learning in the Islamic world. In Spain, Islamic Cordoba became a center for the arts, especially architecture. This is perhaps best exemplified by the Great Mosque at Cordoba, built by theids whom they fought at the most important battle you've never heard of, the Battle of the Talus River. This was like the Ali-Frazier of the 8th century and the Abbasids won, which ended up defining who had cultural influence where, with the Abbasids dominating to the west of the river and China dominating to the east. The Tang also produced incredible art that was traded all throughout Asia. And many of the more famous sculptures from the Tang Dynasty feature figures who are distinctly not Chinese, arena rock pyrotechnics and oh that's why!\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about a relationship. No, not you, college girlfriend. No, not that kind of relationship either. No, Stan, this is a history class. We're going to talk about the relationship between a city, Venice, and an empire, the Ottomans, and in doing so, we're going to return to an old theme here on Crash Course World History, how studying history can make you a better boyfriend and or girlfriend, shipbuilding. Remember that when the Crusaders needed ships for their crazy fourth crusade, they headed to Venice, because the Venetians were famous for their ships, including merchant ships like the galley and the car. Not only could they build ships, they could also sail them to pleasant locales like Constantinople and the Levant, so the Venetians formed trade treaties, sometimes called concessions, with the Byzantines and then when of having to consort with the heathen Egyptians, the Venetians employed a handy story. This is the Piazza San Marco, the number one destination in the entire world for people who like to be pooped on by pigeons. It's also home to this church, which includes some bronze horses you may remember that were looted from Constantinople. And it contains the body of Saint Mark, author of the gospel according to Saint Mark, who had once been the bishop of Alexandria in Egypt. So naturally he while trade was certainly the linchpin of Venice's economic success, they had a diverse economy. They also produced things like textiles and glass, and in fact, Venice is still known for its glass, but they couldn't produce it without a special ash that they used to make the colors. And you'll never guess where that ash came from, the Ottomans. Am I making you a better boyfriend yet? You have to add to your partner's life. You have to color their glass. That to 1481 and expanded Ottoman control to the Balkans, which is why there are Bosnian Muslims today. But Ottoman expansion reached its greatest extent under Suhiman the Magnificent, who ruled from 1520 to 1566. He took valuable territory in Mesopotamia and Egypt, thus securing control over the problem of hereditary nobles altogether by creating both an army and a bureaucracy from scratch so they would be loyal only to the Sultan. How? The Devshear May, a program in which they kidnapped Christian boys, converted them to Islam, and raised them either to be part of an elite military fighting force called the Janissaries, or to be government bureaucrats. Incidentally, which of those gigs would you prefer? Because I think that says a lot about you as a person. Either way, you weren't the Janissaries, who had guns lobbied to be allowed to have families. But until that happened, the Ottoman system of using a mix of slave administrators and eunuchs to run everything worked incredibly well. But to return to the relationship between the Ottomans and the Venetians, after the Ottomans captured Egypt, they pretty much controlled out to be. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

Last week's phrase of the week was, unfortunately,\", 'History'], [\" Watch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App bit by talking about our partner for office hours. Flipgrid. Flipgrid is the free video discussion app for Microsoft with a mission to make learning fun and empowering and accessible for all. It's been used in the classroom for nearly a decade. My kids use it. I was going to say your kids probably use it, but if you're studying for a world history test, you may not have kids, but lots of kids use it for the test, why the test exists, why I'm studying this at all. So why do you study history? Why do you teach history? Why do you think it's important to learn about how I think about the present that I find it just endlessly fascinating. And also people are weird. They do really bizarre things. And that never fails to entertain me. Yeah, I feel the same way. There's something wonderful about knowing that a me understand how we get to now and why now looks the way it does, which also makes me think about how now might look different. With a little hindsight. Yeah, it gives you a little bit of him are just so fun. Oh, he's a great nobody. Nobody looks like rescue. No, I mean, they're they just they seem over the top, really. And I mean, he was over the top. His personality Russia's involvement in World War I was, I think, really the death blow to the Russian monarchy. Nicholas didn't really create any little funky when we get to the Russian revolution. In Petrograd, which we now call St. Petersburg, which they had previously called St. Petersburg, but we'll say Petrograd for now. So on International Women's Day, women's had this parade and started protesting food gave him money and sent him to Petrograd. So Lenin starts making all these speeches about peace, land and bread. And that all sounded pretty good to people who were war weary, landless and hungry. So that's exactly an election, the Bolsheviks lose. So they just dismiss the assembly. In 1918, they signed the Treaty of Breslottasque with Germany, which of course makes sense because that's part of how Lenin got to Russia in the first place and was truly exceptional Mongol Empire, different in so many important ways from the defeated tribes into his own forces and so then he's renamed I guess or becomes known as and thereby livestock and horsepower, which is part of what they relied on. Wow, that is really interesting. A reminder that like left a power vacuum, it left an opportunity for the Mongol Empire to come. And I think it's also really important to reallyman book. And it, you know, if it hadn't been for the growth of this Afro-Eurasian trade, the growth of the Silk Road, you know, these much deeper connections among that ranged all the way from from Japan to Portugal and to Central and Southern Africa, if it hadn ever seen these words written. Yeah, I think it's com con and common form. And now that you say that, I'm not 100% sure either because I mostly see the written. So I hope you're right. Yeah, but to be fair on your test, you'll probably see them written as well. Sure. So talk to us about the Cold War. So I mean, this is com. I the cell gets a little ridiculous, I think, with the names, but people like John Lewis Gaddis had the benefit of hindsight and Détente was going on and some new archival material, though I want to point out not the Soviet archives yet. And the post-revisionist argued for more of a middle ground, kind of pointing to the all this American aid to help rebuild Europe after World War II to strengthen it against Soviet influence and attempting to contain the spread of communism. So containment is a big idea there. Stalin balked at Eastern European countries accepting the Marshall plan because he saw that as American expansionism. And on the other hand, an ideology that focused on the overall average communal good, even to the point of terrific, astonishing oppression, terrific being, I don't mean like in the good way, astonishing oppression of individual expression. And that was sort of like the way I learned it in high school. I don't know if that's the way you learned it, but that's kind Cold War, that these were just like an ideological disagreement about what the human social orders should be with both sides, but at least from our perspective, when I was a kid, especially the communists trying to impose their worldview in the so-called third world, the third world being the first world being the US and its allies, the second world being the Soviets and its allies, and the third world say that the post revisionists were just kind of complicating, looking at more social, political, economic causes and not just that ideological divide. Okay, let's move on to a question from Tim Ruckle who asks, how was Kwame and Krumah and Ghana significant in the non common history and a common destiny whose solidarity and sort of collective self-reliance would empower people of African descent on a global scale. So that's even gonna have an impact on the American civil rights movement. So for instance, Malcolm X travels to Ghana and they're all kind of had sort of state sanctioned underclasses. And so that's, it makes a lot of sense that the alcomax would be going to Ghana and learning about decolonization there and trying to bring some of those ideas back to the US. Here's a question from Gabriel. What are the differences between the Aztecs, the elevation going up and down. So I just think that's kind of an interesting thing about them and how much that must have impacted development. But the Aztec and the Inca had both forcibly taken over and absorbed other cultures. So the Aztecs were because of that. They used, I think it's pronounced Kipus, a series of these kind of knotted chords to record demographic data and do all this accounting. And they required the people that you know, some estimates are as much as 90% of the population of the American. Yeah, this is a particular, this is like a pet issue of mine, Kathy, but I think that disease is overwhelmingly the most important historical force. Like it's huge, right? It completely reshaped Mustafa Kamal Ataturk was. Yeah, so I think this is a fascinating question because you see this in world history, this sway between kind of local control they were. So young Italy, for instance, created by Mazzini, gave Italians this kind of rosy dream drawing on the glory of ancient Rome and the young Turks in the Ottoman Empire forced Abdul Hamid II to restore constitution in 1908. And they're pretty, the Ottoman Empire was pretty ethnically diverse make Turkey, I don't know, bring it into the new age. They did have sort of an enlightened authoritarian rule under Atticirk. He considered gender equality a mark of modernization. So women got the right to vote and hold public office in 1934. Polygamy was abolished. Women were given equal rights and divorce. integration strategy for forming an idea of a people that a people have a shared identity is to say we are not this. We are not this. We hate these people. These actual person who actually lived and died just like you will. I feel like that's probably the right thing to do because history is most importantly a human story, but it's also have to let yourself feel it too, because that was my fear, was that I would become numb to it, that I would not understand the gravity of it anymore. And there's moments where it just hits you like a ton of bricks. Like I remember, you know, visiting Auschwitz and seeing this, they have this room full of hair and it's going to transition to some study tips. Kathy, give us some study tips. I need study tips. I don't know about you or your students or the people watching this, but the pandemic has not been great for my ability to focus. No, I discovered TikTok're overwhelmed by evidence by names, which can be a lot in history or events, look at the College Board key concepts and know the evidence for each of those concepts. Like kind of think about how if that concept were turned into a question, how would you provide evidence for an essay question major in that subject. So, you know, life goes on, you'll be okay. Yeah, I think like it's a hard, it's not such a hard thing to manage because you want to tell people like study hard, like it can be really hard to, very, very professional. I should say a quick thank you to Stan and Zouehah who are running this behind the scenes and doing an extraordinary job. Again, a big thank you to Kathy for joining us today. What a lovely gift. Thank you all. This is kind of spiked in Wayne. So, you know, we talked about the last big period was the Mongol Empire kind of revitalizing it. I'm thinking that part of why it didn't spread completely and this is not like my biggest't know everything. Brady asks, I'm curious what John or Kathy's favorite books are for history of any time period. That's a big question. It's a tough one. Do you have one that comes to mind quickly? Well, I just read this book, The Dawn of Everything, that's like the history of 20th century France, as kind of told through the like micro history of the concierge at where she lived when she was doing her research. And that was just kind of fascinating, because it's like this, you know, how all these global things impact this, this one, you know, just average woman. There's another book I really like called The Woman Beneath infectious disease, which Stan gave me. This was such a great gift. It made me feel really known. Stan gave me this book called The Black Death by Rosemary Horix. Is that her name? And she collected and translated first person accounts of the Black Death. Now, it's a little more limited than I, it's just, it's really powerful to read. And it's, I love reading, I mean, I love reading well translated first person accounts because I'm never gonna be somebody who's able to read Aramaic or read Middle English. And so if it's really well translated, you just, you feel the full humanness of that person and keep telling the stories. And our opportunity and responsibility as people is to listen to those stories and to hear them and to try to make sense of the past through them. And Kathy, I'm so grateful to you for helping me do that through Crash Course European History, but also through all your work. So thank you so much. Thank you so much for joining us. Thanks to everybody who wrote in questions.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about something that ought to be more controversial. The Renaissance. So you probably already know about the Renaissance, thanks to the work of noted teenage mutant ninja turtles Leonardo Michelangelo Donatello and Raphael, but that isn't the whole story. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what about splinter? I think he was an architect. Ugh, me from the past, you're such an idiot. Splinter was a painter, sculptor, somewhat idealized as Roman and especially Greek art had. And this classicizing is also rather apparent in the architecture of the Renaissance, which featured all sorts of Greek columns and triangular pediments and Roman arches and domes. In fact, looking at a Renaissance building, you might even be able to here at Crash Course we try not to focus too much on dates, but if I'm going to convince you that the Renaissance didn't actually happen, I should probably tell you, you know, when it didn't happen. So traditionally, the Renaissance is associated with the 15th and 16th centuries-ish. The Renaissance happened all across Europe, but we're gonna focus on Italy because I want to you'll remember from the Crusades, the Venetians were expert sailors, shipbuilders, and merchants, and as you'll remember from our discussions of Indian Ocean trade, they also had figured out ways to trade with Islamic empires, including the biggest economic power in the region, the Ottomans. Without trading with the Islamic world, especially in pepper, Venice couldn't have afforded all those painters, nor would they have had money to pay for the incredibly fancy clothes primarily found in Anatolia in the Ottoman Empire. So to make the textiles, the Ottomans craved, the Italians needed Ottoman alum at least until 1460. When Giovanni de to be the jumping-off point for thinking both in the Christian and Muslim worlds. And the fall of Constantinople in 1453 helped further spread Greek ideas, because Byzantine scholars fled for Italy, taking their books with them, so we had the Ottomans to thank for that too! And even after it became a Muslim capital, Istanbul was still like the number one destination for book nerds searching for ancient are almost the same, so at least I can tell my mom that when she asks why I'm not a doctor and a lawyer and the guy who discovered the heliocentric solar system. Best wishes, John Green. Alright, so now I'm going to spend the last several minutes telling you why the Renaissance happened in Italy and not in, I don't know, like India or Russia or whatever. I'm going to argue that the Renaissance did not in fact happen. Let's start with the problem of time. any way changed their lives, which were governed by the rising and setting of the sun and intellectually by the Catholic Church. In fact, probably about 95% of Europeans never encountered the Renaissance's opulence or art or modes of thought. We have constructed the Renaissance as important, not because it was so central to the 15th century. I mean, at the time, Europe wasn't the world's leader in anything other than the Renaissance a thing? Not really. It was a lot of mutually interdependent things that occurred over centuries. Stupid truth, always resisting simplicity. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, my name is John Green, you're watching Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about India, which is hard because, A, I only have 10 minutes. Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I don't have time for you today, me from the past. B, when we study history, we tend to study unified polities that we can label, like the Roman Empire, or China, or believers. And this emphasis on unity tends to, C, lead to labels that mask a lot of historical difference, like for instance, Europe, which is such a weird and nebulous word that we don't earliest texts of what will come to be known as Hinduism, although it wasn't known as Hinduism then, and they're responsible for tons of stuff, but we only have 10 minutes, so let's just cut to part two, the caste system. The caste system is one of India's most enduring and fascinating institutions. Let us read from one of the Vedas about Purisha, the universe pervading spirit. When they divided Purisha, in how many different portions did they is defined primarily by birth and by caste. The whole idea is explained nicely in this passage from the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna is talking to the warrior Arjuna. Having regard to your own duty also, you ought not to falter. For there is nothing better cycle of rebirth often called reincarnation. The basic idea is that when you die your soul is transferred to another living thing as it is being born. And if you fulfill your Dharma things improve and you get reborn into a higher being. You don't have to scoop elephant dung anymore. But the ultimate goal is not to be reborn as a Brahmin. The ultimate goal is to be released from the merry-go-round all together. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. 3. To stop suffering, you must rid yourself of desire. This sounds simple enough, but if you've ever been dumped by someone, you know that it is not that easy to just stop desiring. 4. So how do you do it? By following the 8-fold path, which, as you may suspect, is a set of 8 prescriptions on how to live that we don't have time to talk about because, oh, wait, whoop, thought, bubble! You put some learning in our learning so we can learn what we learned! Thanks, thought, bubble. So as a way, totally tangential part six. Did you know the game shoots in ladders, has its origins in ancient India? They call it snakes in ladders. The ladders are steps forward on the path to moksha and the snakes take you away from because it bores me. Right now we're interested in one particular leader from the Marion dynasty, Ashoka. Because Ashoka one of the reasons why Ashoka's empire wasn't actually very Buddhist, because ultimately, Buddhism isn't that concerned with the order of the world. Buddhism argues that the fulfillment of the self will lead to the order of the world. In the end, Ashoka's empire didn't outlast him by much, and soon enough, Buddhism declined in India almost to the point of extinction. Part eight, the big finish. So as anyone who's ever practiced yoga knows, Hinduism is the most flexible of all the world rules.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, and this is the final episode of Crash Course World History, not because we've reached the end of history, but because we've reached the particular middle where I happen to be living. Today we'll be considering whether globalization is a good thing, and along the way we'll try to do something that you may not be used to doing in history classes. Imagining the future. Mr. Green! Mr. Green! In the future, I'm gonna get to second base with Molly Brown. No, you won't, me from the past, but the fact that when asked to imagine the psychology, especially the psychology of upper classes living in the industrialized world. I mean to quote Frederick Jameson, we are so far removed from the realities of production and work that we inhabit a dream world of artificial stimuli and televised experience. Think of it this way, if you had to kill a chicken every time you visited KFC, you would probably eat fewer chickens. Another change of psychology, many historians of gonna be like Minnesota. So here in the last episode of Crash Course World History, in the last 30 seconds I've offended five-sixths of the world's population in the form of non-Catholics and all Republicans and probably some political moderates who are confused about what Obama's health care law will and will not do. Ahh! Stan, maybe I should just make this episode just an extended rant where I reveal all of my political uniquely unhappy family, they could just be shipped in a shipping container. More people can afford to apologize by giving their romantic partners professionally cut and arranged roses than in any time in human history. But in that, we have lost something, which is that the whole idea of flowers is that you had to go out into the the virtuous cycle of more efficiency making things cheaper, which in turn made them easier to buy, which increased demand, which increased efficiency. But from the perspective of the planet, each turn in that cycle takes something, more land under cultivation, more carbon emissions, more resource extraction. That can't go on trade, but its pace has also increased dramatically. In 1960, trade accounted for 24% of the world's GDP. Today, it's more than double that. Almost no human being alive today lives with stuff only manufactured in their home country. But a thousand years ago, only the richest of the rich could benefit from the Silk Road. Still, trade isn't new, and while it's tempting to say that the types of goods being traded, pharmaceuticals, computers The fact is, however, that democracy and political freedom, especially the freedom to participate in and influence the government, have been on the rise all over the world since the 1980s and especially since 1990. For instance, if you looked at the governments of most Latin American countries during most of the environment? Well, here's where we have to imagine the future. Because if some superbug shows up tomorrow and it travels through all these global trade routes and kills every living human, then globalization will have been very bad for human history, specifically by ending it. If climate change continues to accelerate with Jesus and with Muhammad. At other times, not so much. Inequalities are as old as human history, and almost as old as the debate about them. One thing that is new, however, is our ability to learn about them, to discuss them, and hopefully to find solutions for them together as a global community that is better integrated and more connected than it has ever been before. Because here's the other thing about history.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about the life and astonishing death of Captain James Hook, whose death by a crocodile ch- what? James Cook? Is no crocodiles? Stupid history always disappointing me. Well, Captain Cook is pretty interesting too, and his death is a nice entree into as a colony. Within 80 years, Australia went from 1,000 angle Australians to 1.2 million. Equally important, Cook explored and mapped out New Zealand, again paving the way for colonization and paving the way for Crash Course World History to make an announcement. We did it! We finally talked about Australia and New Zealand! We're a real world history. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. his death. Why, in short, was Cook killed? The traditional view is that Cook was killed for some religious reason, although what isn't always clear? One of the find it really interesting opposing view from Gennonith OBS Hecari, and I will remind you that mispronunciation is my thing! Sorry, Gennonith. Anyway, he criticized Solon's interpretation of Cook's death for looking a lot more like European myth than like a Hawaiian ritual. First off, OBS Hecari argues that Cook himself would not easily be confused with Lono. In fact, if he were taken for a god, it in response to Hawaiians taking a bunch of stuff from Cook's boats. This was common practice for Cook. He had done the same thing in Tahiti and other Polynesian islands after islanders had taken European goods. Which by the way happened everywhere Cook went in the Pacific, so maybe he should have figured out that it was like a thing that you were allowed to take stuff off boats in exchange for the right to hang out there. Great say or terrible anthropologist, although to be fair, anthropology hadn't been invented look like a ritual. But even so, the idea that the Hawaiian saw Cook as a God has ended up in a good many accounts of his demise. Why? Well, one explanation is that it fits in with other stories of explorers. You've all probably heard that the Tinos thought Columbus was a God, and that the Aztecs supposedly thought Cortez Very often in history, we make statements about people who haven't written their own story, whether it's Hawaiians or Native Americans or working-class people. And we try to imagine that we're seeing the world as they have seen it. But the best we can really do is offer an approximation. So is it really possible to present a Hawaiian version of Captain Cook's death? Or is the exercise inherently condescending\", 'History'], [\" Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about the French Revolution. Admittedly, this wasn't the French flag until 1794, but we just felt like he looked good in stripes. As does this guy. So while the American Revolution is considered a pretty as evidenced by his well-fed physique and fancy footwear. He and his wife Marie Antoinette also got to live in the very nice palisant Versailles thanks to God's mandate, but enlightenment thinkers like Kant were challenging the whole idea the doors and he was like, sorry guys, you can't go in there. And if you can't dissemble, how are you gonna be a national assembly? Shockingly, the third estate representatives were able to find a different room in France, this time an indoor tennis court where they swore the famous tennis court oath. And they agreed not to give up until a French Constitution was established. So then Louis XVI responded by sending troops to Paris, primarily to quell uprisings over food shortages, but the revolutionaries saw this as a provocation. So they and it was looking like France might be a constitutional monarchy, which might have meant that the royal family could hang on to their awesome house. But then, in October of 1789, a rumor started that Marie Antoinette was hoarding grain somewhere inside the palace, and in what became known as the Women's March, a bunch of armed peasant women stormed the palace and demanded that Louis and Marie Ant history during revolutions, what looked like radical hope and changeotine, envisioned it as an egalitarian way of dying. guillotined in the month of Thermador in the year two. Alright, so while France was broke and fighting like nine wars, the Committee of Public Safety changed the measurements of time because, you know, the traditional measurements are so irrational and religion-y. So they renamed all the months and decided that each day would have ten hours and each hour one hundred minutes. And then after the terror, the revolution pulled back a bit and another new constitution was put into place, this one giving a lot more power to wealthy people. At this point, France was still at war with Austria and Britain Wars that France a king who was either a borbonne or a bonaparte. Now these were no longer absolute monarchs who claimed that their right to rule came from God. They were constitutional monarchs of the kind that the revolutionaries of 1789 had originally envisioned. But what he thought the effects of the French Revolution had been, and he said, it's too soon to say. And in a way, it still is. The French Revolution asked new questions about the nature of people's rights and the derivation of those rights. And we're still answering those questions and sorting through how our answers should shape society today.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to be discussing trade here in the Indian Ocean. Oh my globe, how to globe. We're going to do some new school history today where we talk about a system instead of talking about individuals or some boring dynasty. episode one and nobody ever notices a thing! Sorry, I lost it there. was the wind. The Indian Ocean is home to a set of very special winds called monsoons. You generally hear about monsoons in the context of rain in India, but rather than thinking of monsoons as the rain itself, think of them as the wind that brings a rainy season. The great thing about seasons is that they come regularly and so do the monsoon winds. So if you the trade was dominated by Muslim merchants. Why? Largely because they had the money to build ships, although as we will see in the 15th century, the Chinese state could have changed that balance completely. By the way, I need to point out that when I say the trade was dominated by Muslim merchants, the emphasis. I will however give you a party well or so though. came from Africa, which was kind of emblematic. Africa produced a lot of the raw materials like animal hides and skin and ivory and gold. The Swahili city states imported, finished goods such as silk and porcelain from China and cotton cloth from India, spices and foodstuffs like rice were shipped from Southeast Asia and especially Sri Lanka where black pepper was a primary export and the Islamic world provided everything from coffee to books to weapons. But it wasn't just products that made their way around the eastern hemisphere thanks to the people they were trading with. The conversion of most of a region to Islam where it continues to flourish today is a pretty big deal. But Islam didn't spread as effectively to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, or Vietnam because they weren't centers of trade. How do you become a center of trade? Well, let's zoom in here to the Strait of Malacca. You can see how it could act as a choke point for trade. Any city that controlled that Strait could stop ships from going through it, or at least tax them. And that's eager to take your place and happy to offer lower taxes. It's almost as if the merchants decide where the people with the funny hats go, rather than the other way around. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

And also made this studio possible, and made the warehouse containing the studio possible, a warehouse, by the way, that houses stuff for warehouses. That's right, it's time to talk about the Industrial Revolution. Although it occurred around the same time as the French, American, Latin, American, and Haitian revolutions between, say, 1750 and 1850, the Industrial Revolution was really the most revolutionary of the bunch. In a way, industrial revolution! You get 12 years of free formal education, industrial revolution. Your bed, your antibiotics, your toilet, your contraception, your tap water, your every instance at the British textile industry. The invention of the flying shuttle by John Kay in 1733 dramatically increased the speed of weaving, which in turn created demand for yarn, which led to inventions like the spinning genie and the water frame. Soon these processes were mechanized using water power until the steam engine came along to make flying shuttles really fly in these huge cotton molds. The most successful steam engine was built by Thomas. They didn't name anything after Minukaman to clear water out of mines. Thanks Thought Bubble for that shameless promotion of our beautiful, high- really just been evolution. Best wishes, John Green. So you may have heard any of those rationales for European industrialization, or you may have heard others on items like salt and iron. And that's true, but when it comes to enforcing those monopolies, they also had a long history of failure. So really in a lot of ways China was at least as prime for an industrial revolution as Britain was. So why didn't it happen? Well, Europeans, specifically the British, had two huge advantages to steel, which like so much else in the Industrial Revolution created a positive feedback loop. Because they run on rails, railroads need steel, and because it is rather heavy, steel needs railroads. Secondly, there were wages. Britain, and to a lesser extent, the Low Countries, had the highest wages in the world at the beginning of cotton textiles, despite paying basically the lowest wages in the world. Indian agriculture was so productive that laborers could be supported at a very low cost. And that, coupled with a large population, meant that Indian textile manufacturing could be very productive without using machines, so they didn't need to industrialize. But more importantly from our perspective, there's a strong argument to be made that Indian cotton production helped\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about World War II, finally a war with some color films. So here at Crash Course, we try to make history reasonably entertaining, and fortunately, World War II was hilarious, said no one ever. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, is it's like going to be one of, as exemplified by the infamous rape of Nan King, which featured the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people and is still so controversial today that one, it affects the Netherlands and then all of France all within about nine months between the fall of 1939 and the summer of 1940. So after knocking out most of Central Europe, the Nazis set their sights on Great Britain. But they didn't invade the island, choosing instead to attack it with massive air strikes. I mean the war up on the so-called Eastern Front, although if you were Russian it was the Western Front, and it led to millions of deaths, mostly Russian. Also, 1941 saw a day that would live in infamy when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, hoping that such an audacious attack would frighten the United States toers Russia in the winter time. Unless you are, it's time for the open letter? An open letter to Canada. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, it's Canadian Mittens.

And they're just like, it's so kind of you to mention us. Here's some Mittens. Here, Canada, we're not always to claim that Hitler was crazy or evil, and in fact he was certainly, disabled people, and others that the Nazis deemed unfit. Some historians believe that the Nazis opened the death camps because the Jews weren't dying as fast as the hunger plan had intended. This was a sickening plan, but it made a kind of demented sense. Rather than becoming more involved in global trade as the British! They couldn't have fed or clothed themselves or resisted the Nazis without their colonies and commonwealth.

Stan, I can't help but feel that we have perhaps too many globes. That's better. Today we're gonna learn about the horrible totalitarian Persians and the saintly democracy-loving Greeks. But of course, we already know this story. There were some wars in which no one wore any shirts, and everyone was reasonably fit. The Persians were bad, the Greeks were good, Socrates and Plato are awesome, the Persians didn't even philosophize. The West is the best. Go, team! and almost unheard of in the Persian Empire. All in all, if you had to live in the 5th century BCE, the Persian Empire was probably the best place to do it, unless that is, you believe Herodotus in the Greeks. We all know about the Greeks, architecture, philosophy, literature. The very word music comes from Greek, as does so much else in contemporary culture. Greek poets and mathematicians and architects and philosophers founded a culture that we still identify well translated and absolutely hilarious, students don't like to read them in schools. They're always like, why do we gotta read this boring crap? And this must be particularly galling to you because so much of what you did in your career was make fun of boring crap, specifically in the form of theatrical tragedies. Plus, you frequently used actual crap to make each of these city-states had its own form of government, ranging from very democratic, unless you were a woman or a slave, to completely dictatorial. And the people who lived in these cities considered themselves citizens of that city, not of anything that would ever be justice to all in their private differences. If a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. And when you combine that high-minded rhetoric with the undeniable power and beauty of the art and philosophy that was created in ancient Athens, it's not hard to see it as the foundation of Western civilization. And if you buy into this, you have to be glad that the Melians submit to Athenian rule. The Melians pointed out that they'd never actually fought with the Spartans, and were like, listen, if it's all the same to you, we'd like to go Switzerland on this one, except of course they didn't say that because there was no Switzerland, to which the Athenians responded, and here I am quoting directly, the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must. Needless to say, this is not a terribly democratic or enlightened position to take. This statement, in fact, is sometimes seen as the first explicit endorsement of the so flourishing that gave us the classical age, and plus, if the Persians had won with their monarchy, they might have strangled democracy in its crib and gave us more one-man rule. And that's possible, but as a counter to that argument, let's consider three things. First, it's worth remembering that life under the Persians was pretty good, and if you look at the last 5,000 years of human history, you'll find a lot more successful and stable empires than you will democracies. Second, life under the Athenians wasn't so awesome, particularly if you were a woman or aiest, and most productive lives for humans? If so, it's easy to argue that Greece should have lost the Persian wars. But perhaps lives are supposed to be lived in pursuit of some great ideal worth sacrificing endlessly for. And if so, maybe the glory of Athens still shines, however dimly. Those are the real questions of history. What's the point of being alive? How should we organize ourselves? What should we seek from this life? Those aren't easy questions, but we'll take another crack at them next week when we talk about the Buddha. I'll see you then.\", 'History'], [\" Hi there, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about the fall of Rome. Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Who's that pretty lady? That lady, me from the past, is Emperor Justinian. We'll get to him in a minute. How and when Rome fell remains the subject of considerable historical debate, but today I'm going to argue that Rome didn't really fall as soon as it spread outside of Italy because the further the territory is from the capital, the harder it is to govern. Thus imperialism itself sewed the seeds of destruction in Rome. This was the argument put forth by the Roman historian Tacitus, although he put it in the mouth of a British chieftain. That sounded dirty, but it's not. It's all about context here on Crash Course. To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire. They make a desert and call it peace. There are two ways to overcome this. They were in Latin, they bought into the whole idea of the aristocratic republic. By the third and fourth century CE, though, the Empire had been forced to allow the kind of riff-raff into their army who didn't really care about the idea of Rome itself. They were only loyal to their commanders. And as you know, doubt remember from the historical examples of Caesar, Pompey, Marius, garments. Pants. Oh, which reminds me it's time for the open letter. An open letter to pants. But first let's see what's inside the secret compartment. Oh, look. the eastern half of the empire had its capital in Byzantium, a city on the Bosphorus Strait that Constantine would later rename Constantinople, thereby paving the way for they might be giant's only mainstream hit. Constantine moved his headquarters and thereby the headquarters of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 324 CE. Constantine had lots of reasons to move his capital east. For one thing, he was born in modern-day Croatia. Also, he probably spoke sense of how dramatic this shift was, by the 4th century CE, Constantinople's population had soared while Rome's had gone from 500,000 to 80,000. And although the Byzantine spoke Greek, not Latin, they considered themselves Romans, and if they did, we probably should too. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. There was a lot of continuity between the old Western Roman Empire and the new Eastern one. Politically, each was ruled by a single man, sometimes there were two, and once there were four, but let's most consistently Roman aspect of Byzantine society was that they followed Roman law. The Romans always prided themselves on being ruled by laws, not by men, and even though that wasn't actually the case after the 2nd century BCE, there's ways in which the Eastern Roman Empire was both Roman and not. But maybe the most interesting thing that Justinine ever did was to be married split between the Catholic and Orthodox traditions is complicated, you might even call it Byzantine. What matters for us are the differences between the churches, the main doctrinal one being about the dating of Easter, and the main political one being about who rules whom. Did I get my whom right there Stan? Yes! In the West, there was a Pope, and in the East, there was a patriarch. The Pope is the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

Back to me poisoned to death, leaving Timogen under the control of his older brothers, one of whom he soon killed during an argument. By 19, he was married to his first and most important wife, Borte, who was later kidnapped. This was pretty common among the Mongols. Timogen's mom had also been kidnapped. In rescuing his wife, Timogen proved his military medal, and he soon became a leader of in Mongolia all the way to the Caspian Sea. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So that's a pretty good-looking empire, and sure, a lot of it was pasture or mountains or desert, but the Mongols did conquer a lot of people too. And in some ways, with Genghis' death, the empire was just getting started. His son, Ogadai Khan, expanded the empire even more. And Genghis wishes, John Green. Unfortunately for the Mongols, those guys weren't always working together because Genghis Khan failed to create a single political unit out of his conquests. Instead, after Genghis' death, the Mongols were left with four really important empires called Khanates. The Yuan dynasty in China, the Il Khanate in Persia, the Chagadai be a typhoon. Also, people were terrified of the Mongols. Often, cities would surrender the moment the Mongols arrived just to escape slaughter. But of course, that only happened because there were occasions when the Mongols did, you know, slaughter entire towns. So with all that background, let us return to the question of Mongol awesomeness. First, five arguments for awesome. One, the Mongols really did reinvigorate cross-urasion trade. The Silk Road trading routes that had existed for about excited about. And five, the Mongols were almost unprecedentedly tolerant of different religions. They themselves were shamanists, believing in nature spirits, but since their religion was tied to the land from which they came, they didn't expect new people to adopt it, and they didn't ask them to. So you could find Muslims and Buddhists and Christians, and people of any other religion you can think of prospering throughout the Mongol Empire. And it's that kind of openness that has led historians to go back and re-evaluate the to vote their lives to working instead of scootily pooping. They also weren't particularly interested in artistic patronage or architecture. I mean, your palace may last forever, but my yurt can go anywhere. Five, the Mongols were probably responsible for the Black deaths. By opening up trade, they also opened up vectors for disease to travel, in the case of the plague via fleas infected with Yersinia pestis. And at least according to one story, the Mongols intentionally spread the Week was Hawaiian Pizza.

Right, so was Alfred Crosby plants, and people. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, people are animals. Yeah, that's true me from the past, but just for the sake of simplicity, we're also, if you think about it, microbes are kind to animals, and plants are too. I mean... Oh my God, shut up before I kill you and create a time travel paradox. Microbes, like those hairy blokes back there, were the Spaniards, whose numbers were comparatively tiny. A similar thing happened to the Aztecs, the Moktazuma, who eventually lost to Cortez, was the nephew of a much more powerful king, who died of smallpox. And the New World. But the New World did have one gift for the old world that was pretty destructive. Tobacco. Oh, it's time for the open letter, and there's been a costume change? That doesn't bode well. I want you to smoke until the day after your 65th birthday and then I want you to die so that I collect all of your social security. That inspired me, Mr. Meyer, to quit smoking just eight short years later. Here is an amazing statistic. Cigarettes were handed out to American service men during World War II and more soldiers who started smoking during the war died from smoking than died from the war. So if the new world was looking to extract some beast of burden was the llama, and at best it could carry like 100 pounds. This meant that for the, or even pizza? Indians lived without curry, which contains chilies and new world food. Persians lived without corn, which is a new world food, as are beans, and potatoes, and avocados, and peanuts, and blueberries, the list goes on and on. And these new world crops led to probably the greatest population increase in history, to quote Crosby. It is crudely true that if man's caloric intake is sufficient, the continent? But it isn't. Nor are sweet potatoes, and while New World Grains never replaced rice in Southeastern East Asia, the sweet potato is so common that it is known as the poor person staple in China. Even in Japan, the tomb of the farmer who was reputed to have first brought them to the islands is known as the Temple of the Sweet Potato. And it's also worth noting that corn, while it of globalism and monoculture? Crosby didn't think we were better off. The Columbian Exchange has included man, and he has changed the old and new world, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes intentionally, often brutally.

Slavery is not funny. In fact, it's very near the top of the list of things that aren't funny, so today's episode is going to be a little light on the jokes, but I'm going to help you understand what pre-Civil, the crusade that you will remember as the crazy one. Italian merchants imported thousands of Armenian, Circassian, and Georgian slaves to Italy. Most of them were women who worked as household servants, but many worked processing sugar. And sugar is of course a crop that African slaves later cultivated in the Caribbean. Camera to side note, none of the primary crops grown by slaves, sugar, tobacco, coffee, is necessary to sustain human life. So in a way, slavery is a very early by tragedy of slavery, we need to understand the economics of it. We need to get inside what Mark Twain famously called a deformed conscience. We have to see slaves both as they were, as human beings, and as they were viewed as an economic commodity. Right, so you probably know about the horrendous conditions of board slave ships, which at their largest could hold 400 people. But it's worth underscoring that each slave had an average of four square feet of space. That is slaves would often work 48 hours straight during harvest time, working without sleep in the sweltering sugar press houses where the cane would be crushed in hand rollers and then boiled. Slaves often caught their hands in the rollers and their overseers kept a hatchet on hand for amputations. Ugh, I told you this wasn't gonna be funny. Given, Zhong Ha, the world's greatest admiral? He was technically a slave, so were many of the most important advisors to sue him on the magnificent. So was Darth Vader. But Atlantic slavery was different and more horrifying because it was chattel slavery, a term historians use to indicate that the slaves were moveable property. Oh, it's time for-item-long list! to be slaves. This idea, despite being totally insane, remained popular for millennia. The Greeks popularized the idea that slaves should be traded from far away, but the Romans took it to another level. Slaves probably made up 30% of the total Roman population, similar to the percentage of slaves in America at slavery's height. The Romans also invented the plantation, using mass numbers of slaves to work the land on giant farms called Latif fundia, so-called because they were not fun the first big slave revolts in 869 CE, and it may be that this revolt was so devastating that it convinced the Abbasids that large-scale plantation-style agriculture on the Roman model just wasn't worth it. But by then they'd connected the Aristotelian idea that some people are just naturally slaves with the appearance of sub-Saharan Africans. Spanish in the Portuguese, you no doubt remember, were the Europeans with the closest ties to the Muslim world because there were Muslims living on the Iberian Peninsula until 1492. So it makes sense that the Iberians would be the first\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to discuss 19th century imperialism. So the 19th century certainly didn't invent the empire, but it did take it to new heights, by which we mean lows. Or possibly heights. I don't know, I can't decide. Roll the intro while I think about it. Yeah, I don't know, I'm still undecided. Let's begin with China. When last we checked in, the Chinese responded to what they saw as these unfair trade practices with a stern letter that they never actually sent. Commissioner Lin Jae-Shu drafted a response that contained a memorable threat to cut off trade in rhubarb, silk, and tea, all valuable products of ours without which foreigners could not live. But even if the British had received this terrifying threat to their precious rhubarb supply, they probably as the equivalent of two billion dollars in cash. Also, the Chinese basically gave up all sovereignty to European spheres of influence, wherein Europeans were subject to their laws, not Chinese laws. In exchange for all of this, China got a hot slice of nothing. You might think the result of this war would be a shift in the balance of trade in Britain's favor, but that wasn't immediately the case. In saw it as a real bonus to be able to say that they had colonies, so much so that a children's rhyme in an ABC for baby patriots went, see us for colonies, rightly we boast, that of all the great countries, Great Britain as the most. But it was mostly not to get all Marxist on you or anything about controlling the Americas, unless you were the Incas or the Aztecs, but it didn't work in Africa, because the Africans also had swords and spears and axes. So as much as they might have wanted to colonize Africa in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, Africa's mosquitoes, microbes, and people were too much for them. So what made the difference? Technology. First, steamships made it possible for Europeans to travel inland, that you look like the poor man's Colonel Sanders. First off, you're a possible biggamist.

Partly caused too, by the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her half-brother, George Duckworth.

At the start of the novel we meet Ivan, a high court judge at the pinnacle of society, who appears selfish, vain and cynical. But one day, while helping hang some curtains, Ivan falls from a ladder and becomes aware of an inner pain, which is the first sign of a disease, which is soon diagnosed as fatal. He will have just a few months left to live. As his health declines, Ivan spends a lot of time sitting on the sofa at home. His family, aware at just how outstanding moral courage and generosity. In writing about Ivan Tolstoy wanted us to see his life as representative of all human potential, if only we could wake up to it before it's too late. When he was about 70 Tolstoy pulled together his thinking about being a writer in a long essay, What Is Art? It's one of his most important books, and it Tolstoy proposes totally opposite ideas of the meaning of existence. Yet he insisted that even as Sophia grew more and more irritable, despotic and uncontrollable, he continued to love her, though he admitted that he had given up trying to express his feelings. There is no greater tragedy than the tragedy of the marital bed he wrote. Finally, when he was past 80, Tolstoy couldn't take it anymore and deserted his wife and family. He ran away in the middle of a freezing November night.\", 'Literature'], [' Jane Austen is loved mainly as a guide to fashionable life in the Regency period, but her own vision of her task was radically different.

It makes being in love seem like the most romantic experience in life. Verter asks himself, what is a life without romantic love? A magic lantern without a lamp? This deeply charming novel was the bestseller across Europe for the next 25 years. Napoleon boasted he'd read it seven times. The story has a miserable ending. Charlotte doesn't really love the troubles that afflict all couples over time, and of the need to abandon some of the heady hopes of the early days, for the sake of tranquility and administrative competence.

In September 1786, after 10 years in the Weimar Civil Service, when his 40th birthday was coming into view, Gerta got fed up with Germany, the coal, the bad food, and this was key for him, the lack of sex. So he went to Rome with a very classical idea of the point the market, the pantheon, a baroque church designed by Benini, which she hadn't even realised were famous. They were just the buildings that happened to be around when she was getting the milk and the aubergines. For Gerta, the point of travel isn't relaxation or just taking a break from routine.

But once he's mastered this side of himself, he moves on. The Faustian idea is that in order to develop fully, we have to flirt with things that are quite dangerous but hold on to a sense of higher purpose.

The life of people not especially blessed with material goods, people who work in ordinary jobs, who don't have much of an education, who won't achieve greatness, and yet nevertheless love, care for others, work, have fun, raise children, and have large thoughts about the deepest questions in ways that mining village contained more intelligence and wisdom than the British cabinet or the high table of an oxbridge college. Orwell especially likes the lack of prudishness and hypocrisy among the ordinary people he met. One thing one notices he writes, if one looks directly at the common people, especially in the big towns, is that they are not puritanical. They are inveterate gamblers, drink as much beer as their wages will permit, a devoted to partly invisible, and the more important the work they do, the less visible they are. Orwell's love of the ordinary inspired his curiosity about a range of themes not often considered in literature. He thought about and wrote in praise of comics and country walks, dancing and flowers. He wrote bravely in defense of English cooking. Kippers, Yorkshire pudding, Devonshire cream, muffins and crumpets, he wrote, and then asked, foreign phrases now current in English. upon a form, the fable, which would carry his story to a mass audience and could be understood as he put it by more or less anyone. So Orwell did what Esop, Walt Disney, Lefnolten and Beatrix Potter, among many others, have done, which is to tell a story about humans via animals. In the process Orwell revealed that the superstate of Oceania, and locked in perpetual ideological conflict with two other blocks, Eurasia and East Asia. Like all great dystopian novels, Orwell's book was in attempt to warn his own society about its own alarming trends. For example, apparently democratic ones that give their citizens the distinctive feeling that they are free, while in fact blinding them with constant sexual titillation and sentimental distractions.\", 'Literature'], [\" How to Win Friends and Influence People is the title of possibly the most famous book of the 20th century. It's also one of the books most routinely ridiculed by people who think they're clever. Why on earth would an intelligent person need help with something as basic as that? Intellectuals have mocked down the decades. And in any case, good people don't need to win friends and influence people. The issues that Carnegie addresses are utterly basic. We spend vast parts of our lives trying to build relationships, hoping to get others to appreciate who we are, to understand us and grasp what we have to offer them. And yet our efforts are very often far from successful. Carnegie pinpointed things we desperately need to know and quite good at abstruse things. And yet, we trip up on issues that are diametrically opposite in character, that are simple, emotional, and interpersonal. They involve not demonstrating how much we know, but rather showing how much we like other people. Knowledge of the truth is a tiny fraction of what it takes to make the truth effective in the world.

He is still hugely important to us because of his devotion to some crucial themes, the idea of the grandeur of ordinary life. His second city of the British Empire. Like his father, Joyce was fiercely opposed to Ireland's status as a British colony and supported the cause of Irish independence. Joyce was educated by the Jesuits and early on at school began to reveal his knack for foreign languages. By the time he arrived at University College Dublin, Joyce was writing book reviews, poems and short stories, but and Georgia. Joyce eked out a meager existence as a language teacher at the Berlin School and translating Irish writers like Yates and Oscar Wilde into Italian. 1914 turned out to be Joyce's year of breakthrough when and he's very much given to daydreaming about all the things he would love to go right in his life, but which we know won't happen. He farts, he likes looking at women in. Joyce is saying that the apparently little things that happen in daily life. Eating, feeling sorry for someone, feeling sorry for oneself, putting the washing on the clothesline. These aren't really little things at all. If we look at them through the right lens, they are revealed as beautiful, serious, deep and fascinating in the street. This is what it means to be human, and we'd perhaps also to reflect the speed of the mind in action. Joyce went in for many portmanteau words, two more words stuck together to create a new one. A fun for all is a fun funeral or a fun for all. A bisect cycle is a bisexual or a bicycle for sex. Joyce twisted prestigious names going on in the world and the minds of characters. Joyce pushed one possibility of the realistic novel as far as it could possibly go, into a realm as mysterious, haunting and perplexing as the dreams of a stranger. Joyce spent the great time in the world us and teaching us to do so habitually. The second step for an artist in Joyce's view is to bring claritas or clarity to things, which means shining the light of reason into the murkier parts of experience and life. The paradox is that Joyce did just this, but it is attempt to be utterly clear about what being human is actually like. He created works which are in places utterly\", 'Literature'], [\" One of the world's most famous phrases is, one must cultivate one's own garden.

They have known persecution, shipwrecks, rapes, earthquakes, and indeed they probably deserve to. I never bother with what's going on in Constantinople. I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there. Having said these words, the old man invited the strangers into his house. His two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they'd made themselves of the book known only as the Turk. We must cultivate our garden, or as it has variously been translated, we must grow our vegetables, we must tend to our lands, or we need to work our fields.

For Flaubert, the French bourgeoisie could be a repository of the most extreme, prudery, snobbery, smugness, racism and pomposity. It's strange how the most banal utterances of the bourgeoisie sometimes make me marvel, he once complained in stifled rage. There are gestures, sounds of people's voices that I just can't get over.

How fortunate it's already morning. In a moment the servants will be up. You will be return to share.

Perhaps the immobility of the things around us is imposed on them by our certainty that they are themselves and not others by the immobility of our mind confronting them. However, that may be, when I woke us, my mind restlessly attempting, without success, to discover where I was, everything revolved around me in each one, the location of the doors, the angle at which the light came in through the windows, the existence of a hallway, along with a thought I had had as I fell asleep and that I had recovered upon waking. My stiffened side, trying to guess its orientation, would imagine, for instance, that it lay facing the wall in a big can of beadusalu's in the country. Could Lord, it's ten o'clock or even later, that a finished dinner.

For many years have passed since Compre, where, however late we returned, it in the end I would recall them all in the long reveries that followed my waking. Winter bedrooms in which, soon as you are in bed, you bury your head in a nest that you weave the most disparate things, a corner of the pillow, the top of the covers, a bit of shawl, the side of the bed, and you sleep almost in the open air, like a tit-mouse, rocked by the breeze on the tip of a ray of light. Sometimes the Louis XVI bedroom, so gay that even the first night I had not been too unhappy there, and where the slender columns that lightly supported my nostril restive, my heart pounding, until habit had changed the colour of the curtains, silenced the clock, taught pity to the cruel, oblique mirror, concealed if not driven out completely, the smell of the vetiver, and appreciably diminished the apparent height of the ceiling. Generally, I wouldn't try to go back to sleep right away. I'd spend the greater part of the night remembering our life in the old days, in Kombraer at my great-arts house, in Balbec, in Paris, in Dossier, in Venice, elsewhere still, remembering the places, the people I'd known there, what I'd seen of them, what I my bedroom had acquired for me, and which, except for the torment of going to bed, had made it tolerable for me. Now I no longer recognized it, and I was uneasy there, as in a room in some hostel or chalet to which I had come for the first time straight from the railway train.
