Everything from the social and economic inequalities to marriage and family formation to political and religious institutions. Sociologists answer questions like,\", 'Sociology'], [\" Have you ever met a friend's parents and realized that your friend was basically a mini-me of their mom? Not just because they both have brown hair or a pointy nose. It's how they talk. The way they both like making silly puns, their attitudes and beliefs.

And pretty much learned how to be a human being by watching her. This is the age-old question. Nature or nurture. Nature is the part of human behavior that's biologically determined and instinctive.

Not really.\", 'Sociology'], [\" As we launch into our final segment of Crash Course Sociology, I'm sure one of the things that you've learned by now is that sociology touches on everything. It helps us understand every aspect of society, even those that we think are strictly personal, like religion, sex, and gender. And the same is true for another aspect of your personal life. Your health, and how you take care of it. Many of the factors that determine your health aren't biological, but are social and cultural.\", 'Sociology'], [\" If you ask a medieval peasant, whether they liked working two days a week for their Lord while they barely made enough food for themselves, they'd probably say no. And if you ask a factory worker today, whether they like making a tiny fraction of what their company's CEO makes, it's probably have a similar answer. But even though huge numbers of people don't want inequality, it still exists, and it has for a long time. And the systems of stratification that we talked about last week don't really help explain this. They can tell us about how this inequality happens, but they can't tell us why.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Last week, we introduced Max Weber's three dimensions of social stratification. Economic class, social status, and power. But how do those three things actually interact in the real world? What does social stratification look like in the here and now?

For all the non-Americans watching, don't you worry we will be getting to stratification around the world later.

These are all good answers, but Max Weber had a different one. The most important change wasn't technical or economic or political. The biggest change he said, the one that best distinguishes the modern world from the traditional one was a difference in the way we think.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Over the last few weeks, you've heard me say many times that Deviants isn't necessarily criminal. But of course, sometimes it is. Understanding crime sociologically means we need to answer some basic questions. Like, what is the nature of crime? Who commits crimes and why? And how does society respond to it? You'll see pretty quickly that these questions are actually all tangled together, and you can't untangle them.\", 'Sociology'], [\" The healthcare system in America is complicated. Doctors, hospitals, insurance and drug companies, it can be hard to navigate all the moving parts of healthcare, and it's even harder if you're trying to do it when you're sick. Theory and statistics can give us a broad understanding of the social and cultural forces that affect health. But for the average American making choices about health care, the questions that matter most are of the practical ones. After all, when you're running the fever, the most important question is, where can you find a doctor to make you better? And then\", 'Sociology'], [\" Let's talk about sex. It's totally okay if that makes you want to cringe. After all, most people will tell you that sex is private. Not something that people generally talk about. At least not in class. Besides, sex is usually thought of as a deep, primable part of ourselves. It's a matter of drives and instincts of biology and psychology. And if sex and sexuality are both primable and private, can a social science tell us anything about them? Of course it can. Because no matter how natural and private you think they are, sex and sexuality are still a part of every society.\", 'Sociology'], [\" How does a family become a family? Well, when two people love each other very much, I'm joking, I'm joking, kind of. As we discussed last week, American families often form around marriages. So romantic relationships can be a first step in the stages of family life. It might seem strange to think of dating as a part of family formation. After all, when you're swiping right on Tinder, you're probably not thinking about adding that person to your family. But families are a dynamic social institution changing over the course of your life. What the word family conjures in your mind is going to be very different when you're 16 versus when you're 16.\", 'Sociology'], [\" You're a good citizen, right? You voted in the last election, or you're looking forward to voting in the future. You pay your taxes. You're happy to exercise the full range of your civic responsibilities. The point is, you might already know all about how your government works. If you don't, and you're American, well, there's a crash course for that. But even if you're an informed citizen who knows every line of your constitution by heart, that doesn't mean you know why your government works. For that, we need a different kind of political knowledge. Civics can tell you how your system works, but sociology can help you understand why.\", 'Sociology'], [\" I think you all agree with me that racism is a loaded topic. What is or isn't racist or who is or isn't racist? Is one of the most hotly debated issues in American society? Is racism about what you believe or is it about how you behave toward other races? What is prejudice? And why does it exist? Sociology can't make racism go away and it can't make it any less disturbing. It probably can't even make the issue of race and racism less loaded than it already is. But it can help us understand racism and understanding is an important start.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Hello, I'm Nicole Sweeney and I have a question for you. Have you ever wondered how the world works? I'm not talking about atoms and molecules or wave functions and chemical reactions. I mean the world of people. For example, have you ever wondered who goes to college and why?

You don't know the answer so you look desperately around the room for help. Finally, one of your classmates whispers it to you. So you say the answer and the moment of terror is over. You go back to daydreaming to your goes back to teaching and everyone's happy. A lot of stuff just happened there. Stuff that raises many questions. Like, why are you worried about giving the right answer? Why are you worried about answering the question at all? And why does your classmate help you out when it could get them in trouble? If you want the right answers to these questions, we need to talk about social interaction. And we need to talk about\", 'Sociology'], [\" We've all complained about having to go to school at some point, right? I mean, who decided that teenagers need to get to school at the ungodly hour of 7 a.m. That right there seems like a big drawback that we didn't consider and we talked about the positive functions of schools. Last week we discussed all the good things about schooling. How it helps people learn about the world, how it helps kids meet other kids their own age, and how there are countless other ways that it helps society function better.\", 'Sociology'], [\" How do you define race? If you had to describe why you think your a member of one race and someone else was a member of a different one, you'd probably focus on appearances. Your skin, your hair, maybe even the structures of your bodies and faces. But most of the time, those physical criteria mean different things depending on the culture your part of. And obvious example is skin color. We use the words white and black to describe two races. But the distinction in skin color between those races isn't as clear cut. A white person who spent the summer at the beach might come home with brown skin.\", 'Sociology'], [\" We're getting old. That's true on a personal level, of course. Every second you're sitting there, surfing the internet, you're getting one second older. But it's also true in a global sense. The average age of humanity is going up and going up pretty rapidly, especially in North America, Europe and many parts of Asia. Our report from the United Nations shows that the median age of the world population has risen from 23 in 1950 to 30 as of 2015. And by 2050, the median age for the entire world will be 36. In more developed countries like the United States, these trends are even\", 'Sociology'], [\" Social class in America can be hard to talk about, and not just because you may find it awkward to discuss whose poor and whose rich or who has more power and who has less. As sociologist, the difficulty for us is in pinning down exactly what we mean by social class. There isn't just one definition of it, and the definition you use will depend on what society you're interested in. If we go by Marx's definition, we have two classes, which was he who owned the means of production and the proletariat who do the labor. But this might be too simplistic for our world.\", 'Sociology'], [\" If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump too? It's an element of many an exasperated parent, but it's also kind of a profound sociological question. Because when you're talking to your parents, the answer is always no. But with a right group of friends, you might be quite happy to take a dive in the water. The thing is, you're a different person when you're a part of a group, and you're a different person in different groups. A family, a group of friends out for a swim, a business meeting, and a choir are different kinds of groups, and the same person can be a member of\", 'Sociology'], [\" Everyone loves to go to Rags to Richest Story, books and movies and music are full of this idea. Whether it's Gatsby turning himself from a nobody to a somebody or Drake starting from the bottom, there's something appealing about the idea that anyone can make it if they try hard enough. And more than maybe anywhere else, that idea is embraced in the United States where the mythos of the land of opportunity is practically part of our foundation. But is the U.S. a land of opportunity? Can anyone move up the rungs of the social ladder? Or is the American dream just that? A dream.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Do you think you're middle class? If you're American, there's a pretty good chance that you do. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015, 87% of those surveyed, identified themselves as middle class. That's a pretty big middle, but your intuition about what the middle class is, like who includes and what constitutes a middle class lifestyle, probably isn't the full picture. And a lot of questions that sociologists try to answer are questions just like this.\", 'Sociology'], [\" How many cultures are there in the world? We've talked a lot about the things that make a culture, a culture, things like norms and symbols and languages. So we haven't really discussed how you lump all those little things together and say, yes, these are the things that belong together. These things are culture A and these other things are culture B. So what are the rules of culture? Well, culture isn't just about nationality or the language you speak. You and another person can live in the same country and speak the same language and still have totally different cultural backgrounds. Within a single country, even within a single city, you see lots of different cultures. And each person can live in a different country. And you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country, and you can live in a different country,\", 'Sociology'], [\" Whermillated that. Seriously, we've spent a lot of time learning about the origins of sociology and all of the founders we've talked about so far have been met. That's because when sociology was becoming an academic discipline, women didn't have the same access to education. In fact, it was considered improper in the 19th century for women to write articles and give talks to the public. And this continued for decades with some of the top universities not allowing female students until the 1970s. Which sucks. But it also raises an important question. Why do women in men get treated differently? This is a question that sociologists can answer. Or, well, we can at least try it.\", 'Sociology'], [\" A person holding up a convenient store and a pacific at a protest might seem like polar opposites, but they actually have something in common. So do an American vegan preparing a meal at home, and a white-collar criminal committing tax fraud, and a runaway slave. They're all social deviance. We've spent a lot of time so far talking about house society fits together and how it functions, but we can't cover that in any meaningful way without also talking about the people who don't fit. We have to talk about who's normal and who's deviant, and how they get to be that way.\", 'Sociology'], [\" So the fact that we have a society at all is kind of amazing. Think about it. People with different interests, different minds of money, members of different subcultures, races and sexual orientations, somehow all managed to hold together in this thing we call society. A thing that at least kind of works, but it doesn't just hold together. Society has to somehow endure a period of intense change without falling apart. Political change, technological change, population growth, economic crises, all these things can be massively disruptive.\", 'Sociology'], [\" You've probably heard of Karl Marx. He's remembered as the father of divisive political movements, and his name is still sometimes thrown around in American politics as a kind of slur. But I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about Marx the philosopher. Marx the scholar. In the 19th century, a time defined by radical inequality and rapid technological and political change in Europe, Marx was concerned with one question. What does it mean to be free? Starting from this question, Marx developed an entire theory of history, and in doing so, he laid the foundation for the paradigm of conflict theory and sociology. Ultimately pushing the discipline to look at questions of power.\", 'Sociology'], [\" The average American spends 13 and a half years of their life in school, and that's not coming the amount of time that you spend watching Crash Course. Getting the bachelor's degree means spending upwards of 17 years as a student, and advanced degrees, like medical degrees or PhDs, can talk on another four to six years on top of that. So, why do we spend so much time in the classroom? With so much information available to us with just a few taps on our phones and computers, it might seem like sitting in a classroom to learn about the world isn't really necessary anymore.\", 'Sociology'], [\" What puts the science in social science? The things you probably think of as science, like biology, or physics, or chemistry, can seem a world apart from sociology and the concepts we've introduced so far. But sociology is a type of science. It's just not one that uses beakers or microscopes. Rather than investigating the physical, natural world, sociology explores the social world. Now, there are different schools of thought within sociology about the best way to understand the social world. But one of the primary means of conducting sociology uses many of the same basic principles and methods as any of your hard clinical sciences.\", 'Sociology'], [\" What do you, as you're watching me right now, have in common with a toddler who's being read a bedtime story? I'll give you a clue. It's also something you have in common with the kids in the breakfast club, as well as with a soldier going through bootcamp. Give up? You're all being socialized. It's also the title of the episode. Probably saw that. Each of us is surrounded by people, and those people become a part of how we act and what we value. This is known as socialization, the social process through which we develop our personalities and human potential and learn about our society and culture.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Every year we consume immense quantities of goods that make their way from one side of the planet to the other. But have you ever wondered how this enormous flow of goods is organized, so that stuff made in China is available in stores in rural Montana? It happens because formal organizations make it happen. Our world is structured by formal organizations, and life is we now know it can exist without them. But it's not all rainbows and butterflies and incredibly extensive trade networks, because within these organizations, lurks some pretty substantial dangers.\", 'Sociology'], [\" Why do some people think that drinking black coffee is manly while ordering a pumpkin spice latte is girly? Don't let them fool you. Pumpkin spice has no gender. Pumpkin spice is for everyone. The gendering of inanimate objects is a super common practice and it's a good example of how societies create markers of gender that have nothing to do with anything biological. Gender as you'll recall refers to the personal and social characteristics but not the biological traits that we associate with different sexes.\", 'Sociology'], [' Until about 12,000 years ago, the largest group of people ever assembled.

Now a cell is essentially just a bundle of chemicals.\", 'Biology'], [\" Let's go now guys welcome to your 26-by-all-IG video and in this video I want to talk to you guys about something called the Mido Conjuria. Now the Mido Conjuria is another organelle in the cell and the job of this organelle is to take food that you eat and convert it into energy that the cell can use. Now we already know that your cell needs energy for a bunch of different things and these energy to do things like a move to grow and in addition to that.\", 'Biology'], [\" What's up guys, welcome to your 17th biology tutorial and in this video. I want to talk to you guys about transporting materials through the plasma membrane or cell membrane, whatever you want to call it. So we already know that things need to get across the plasma membrane and that's because first of all, cells create things for other parts of the body. So obviously when they're created inside the cell, they need to ship out towards other parts of the body.\", 'Biology'], [\" Now, metaphase is the next stage of mitosis. Now what happens here is we already know that the spindles are attached to the chromosomes. So what's going to happen is that those spindles are actually going to head to opposite ends or poles of the cell. So as this happens, go ahead and draw a spindle on this side of the cell and one goes on the completely opposite side.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys welcome to your 15th biology tutorial and in this tutorial we're gonna start talking about cells. Now I know that we talked a little bit about cells before and we know things like all living things are made up of these smaller living things called cells and also the cell is basically the smallest living piece of an organism.\", 'Biology'], [' What is going on guys my name is Bucky Roberts and welcome to your very first tutorial in biology now in this video series what I want to do is I want to talk to you guys about many different topics concerning biology for example I want to talk to you guys about DNA and genetics and cells in bacteria in life in a whole bunch of interesting stuff But since this is the very first video I think what we should do in this video is just stick with the very basics and the first thing I want to do is talk to you guys about what is', 'Biology'], [\" Well, the cytochrome oxidase is actually going to wait till it has four electrons. So right now it has four electrons. So after that it's going to combine with a O2 molecule. And it's going to go ahead and it's going to grab a O2 molecule from the matrix right here. So one of these O2s is going to go right up there. I just don't long go ahead and keep the arrow there. Whatever. And it's also going to combine with eight hydrogen ions. So eight.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys welcome to your 506 biology lesson and in this tutorial I want to finish myosis 1 by talking about the last phase which is telephase 1 and also what we're gonna be doing is hopping into myosis 2 which is kind of the second phase of myosis. So basically after myosis 1 we end up with two half-loid daughter cells. So let me go ahead and draw those right now. Here's one. Here's another one and of course I'll go ahead and do this.\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? Welcome to your sixth biology tutorial in this tutorial. I want to talk to you guys about the pH scale. Now what the pH scale is is it's basically a system of classifying how acidic or how basic a solution is and the scale actually goes from zero to 14 and I know that it's really odd and numbering system zero to 14 and if a solution is acidic it's going to fall in the range of zero to seven.\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys welcome to your 12th biology tutorial and in this tutorial. I want to talk to you guys about New clay acid pretty freakin sweet. So new clay acid is actually really important in your body and I say that it's important because first of all without it You'd be dead. So you know, it's kind of important. I guess and I know I keep saying your body, but the fact is that new clay acid actually exists in every single living thing on earth\", 'Biology'], [\" So one last time let me go ahead and explain what happens because wow this is this diagram got very confusing very quick Basically, let me go ahead and pick white basically we start with NADH which is an electron carrying molecule. It's gonna give its electrons to NADH dehydrogenase. Now as this happens,\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys, welcome to your 38th biology video and in this video we're gonna be finishing up the Krebs cycle because right now we are in step number 6. There's only 8 to go and whenever we left off we left with a molecule called.\", 'Biology'], [\" What the heck is going on guys? We'll come to your 54th biology lesson and in this lesson we're gonna get started talking about the different phases or stages of myosis. So if you remember from the last tutorial the very first one was pro phase one. So pro phase one is actually similar to pro phase from my tosis in a lot of different ways. So the very first characteristic of pro phase is that your chromosomes are gonna condense and become visible. Very similar to pro phase in my tosis.\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys welcome to your 37th biology video and in this video what I want to do is basically continue where we left off in the last video and that's with step 3 and what molecule we had is iso citrate which is of course the six carbon isomer of citric acid now the first thing that it does in step number 3 is this iso citrate right here it actually gives one of its hydrogens to a molecule called NAD\", 'Biology'], [\" Alright guys welcome to your 30 fifth biology video and in this video we're gonna be going over the crebs Cycle and it's also called the citric Asad cycle So what do you want to college just go ahead and take your pick? I'm gonna call it the crebs cycle because I think that's what more people commonly do but if you want to call it the citric asad cycle go ahead But the important thing is in the last tutorial we've left or we ended with pyruvic acid which is c3 h4\", 'Biology'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about a relationship. No, not you college girlfriend. No, not that kind of relationship either. No, stand this is a history class.

Let's begin today with a question. Why am I alive? Also, why don't I have any eyes? Ah, that's better.

This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about Russia, which means we get to talk about this guy again. We haven't talked about Russia much so far because one, it's complicated and two. Yeah, actually Governor Yuparoo's skill a little bit because I had some Russian in college and that makes it difficult to miss pronounced things, which is my thing. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, why don't you take Russia? Well, because I had this big crush on a Russian major, but anyway, I'm sure I'll still miss pronounced everything.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today I think is going to get a little bit confusing because we're going to talk about Revolution and Independence in Latin America. It's a big confusing because one Latin America is big, too. It's very diverse. Three Napoleon makes everything complicated and four as we've seen in the past. Sometimes revolutions turn out not to be that revolutionary.\", 'History'], [\" Hi there, I'm John Green. You're watching Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about... Iraq. No, you're purportedly smart. Globally we're going to talk about Mesopotamia. I love Mesopotamia because it helped create two of my favorite things, writing and taxes. Why do I like taxes? Because before taxes, the only certainty was death. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, did you know that you're referencing Mark Twain? I'm not referencing Mark Twain me from the past. I'm referencing Benjamin Franklin who was probably himself referencing the unfortunately named playwright Christopher Bullock.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World history and today we're gonna talk about the French Revolution. Admittedly this wasn't the French flag until 1794, but we just felt like he looked good in stripes. As does this guy? Huh? So while the American Revolution is considered a pretty good thing the French Revolution is often seen as a bloody and arctic mess in the world. Mr. Green, I bet like always it's way more complicated than that. Actually, no, it's pretty terrible. Also, like a lot of revolutions in the end it exchange an authoritarian regime for an authoritarian regime.\", 'History'], [\" Hi there, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about the fall of Rome. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, who's that pretty lady? That lady made from the past is Emperor Justinian.

How and when Rome fell remains the subject of considerable historical debate, but today I'm going to argue that Rome didn't really fall until the middle of the 15th century.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to learn about the Roman Empire, which of course began when two totally non-fictional twins, Romulus and Remus, who'd been raised by Wolves founded a city on seven hills. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what is SPQR stand for? It means shut, piehole, quickly, rap scallion. Now, it means Senator Spapula's K-Romanus, one of the motto of the Roman Republic.

This is Crash Course World History and today we're gonna talk about nationalism. The most important global phenomenon of the 19th century and also the phenomenon responsible for one of the most commented von aspects of Crash Course. My globes being out of date. USS are not a country. Rodija South Vietnam. Sudan with no South Sudan. Yugoslavia. Okay, no more inaccuracies with the globes.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about World War I. The so-called Great War. World War I wasn't the most destructive war or the first total war and it certainly wasn't despite its billing the war to end all wars, but it was the war to change all wars. World War I changed our outlook. It normalized cynicism and irony, which I think you agree are the dominant lenses for describing our world today. Basically, I'd argue that World War I helped make possible everything from the Simpsons to intentionally unattractive Mustaches.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History. And today we're going to do some comparing contrast because that's what passes for hip and world history circles. Right, so you've probably heard of Christopher Columbus who in 1492 sailed the ocean blue and discovered America, a place that had been previously discovered only by millions of people. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Columbus was just a lucky 80. Yeah, no. Here's a little rule of thumb me from the past. If you're not an expert in something, don't pretend to be an expert. This is going to serve you well both in your academic career and in your kissing career. Moving on!\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're gonna talk about something that ought to be more controversial. The Renaissance. So you probably already know about the Renaissance thanks to the work of noted teenage ninja turtles Leonardo, Michael Angelo, Donatello, and Raphael, but that isn't the whole story. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what about Splinter? I think he was an architect. Me from the past, you're such an idiot. Splinter was a painter, sculptor, and an architect. He was quite a Renaissance rat.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about slavery. slavery is not funny. In fact, it's very near the top of the list of things that aren't funny. So today's episode is going to be a little light on the jokes. But I'm going to help you understand what pre-civil war Americans often you've been mystically referred to as the peculiar institution.\", 'History'], [\" Hi there, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about the Crusades. Oh, stand we out to talk about the Crusades. I hate them. Here's the thing about the Crusades, which were a series of military expeditions from parts of Europe to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. The real reason they feature so prominently in history is because we've endlessly romanticized the story of the Crusades. We've created the simple narrative with characters to root for and to root against, and it's been endlessly idealized by the likes of Sir Walter Scott and their knights with swords and lion hearts.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're gonna talk about World War II. Finally, a war with some color films. So here at Crash Course we try to make history reasonably entertaining and fortunately World War II was hilarious. Said no one ever. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, is it's like gonna be one of the unfunny ones where you build to the big melodramatic conclusion about how I have to imagine the world more complexly.

The history and today we're going to do some legitimate comps, for those you into that kind of thing. Stan, I can't tell but feel that we have perhaps too many globes. That's better. Today we're going to learn about the horrible totalitarian Persians and the saintly democracy loving Greeks. But of course we already know this story. There were some wars in which no one wore any shirts and everyone was reasonably fit. The Persians were bad. The Greeks were good. Socrates and Plato are awesome. The Persians didn't even philosophize. The West is the best. Go team.

Mr. Green, Mr. Green. I don't have time for you today, me from the past B. When we study history, we tend to study unified policies that we can label, like the Roman Empire or China or believers. And this emphasis on unity tends to see the labels that mask a lot of historical difference, like for instance Europe, which is such a weird and nebulous word that we don't even know what it means.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about Africa. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, we've already talked about Africa. Egypt is an Africa. You haven't shut up about the entire course. Yeah, that's true from the past, but Africa is big. It's like super big. Much bigger than it appears on most maps, actually. I mean, you can fit India and China and the United States if you just fold in Maine. All of that fits in Africa. Like any huge place, Africa is incredibly diverse, and it's a mistake to focus just on Egypt. So today, let's go here. South of the Sahara Desert.\", 'History'], [\" I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to be discussing trade here in the Indian Ocean. Oh my globe how to globe. We're going to do some new school history today where we talk about a system instead of talking about individuals or some boring dynasty, no stand-not that kind of dynasty. Yes, that kind of dynasty. So many world history classes still focus on people who wore funny hats and how their antics shaped our lives, right? And while it's interesting and fun to note that for instance King Charles the sixth of France believed that he was made out of glass relentlessly focusing on the actions of the world.

For instance, you probably know what this is and what this is. You probably don't know what that is. Google it. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, why do you think people know so little about Islamic history? Did you just ask an interesting non-annoying question me from the past? I think we don't know much about early Islamic history because we don't learn about it.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World. This is Oh My Gosh! Today we're gonna talk about war! Ah! Blows you everywhere! Traditionally historians are pretty keen on wars because they feature clearly delineated beginnings and middles and ends and because they always have a fair bit of death and drama and mortally wounded generals who have great last words like let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of those trees. Whereas the last words of plague victims are always like, oh, sorry plague victims. As if you don't have enough troubles now, you've got me teasing you a bit.\", 'History'], [\" Hi there, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're gonna talk about Jesus. So this is a Roman coin from around the time Jesus was born in the Roman Empire and it calls Augustus the Emperor the Son of God. So let's just state at the outset that in 4 BCE being the Son of God or at least being the Son of A God was not such an unusual thing, but a poor Jew being the Son of God. That was news.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today you aren't going to get a blow by blow chronology of the American Revolution and you aren't going to get cool biographical details about Thomas Jefferson or George Washington, but you are going to get me not wearing any pants. Mr. Green, did you know that George Washington might have had slave teeth and planted into his jaw? Yeah, I did me from the past and while it's fun to focus on metaphorically resonant details, what we're concerned with here is why the American Revolution happened and the extent to which it was actually revolutionary.\", 'History'], [\" Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History. And apparently it's Revolutions month here at Crash Course because today we are going to discuss the often neglected Haitian Revolutions. Haitian Revolutions are totally fascinating and they involve two of my very favorite things. One ending slavery and two Napoleon getting his feelings hurt. I can't help myself Napoleon, I like to see you suffer.\", 'History']]\n"
